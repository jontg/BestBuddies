I'll tell you what.  You give us your "want"  list and we'll make sure you can do it all.
Of course, after you assemble the chair.

What was Lowery doing in San Antonio??

Good to hear from you.  The name of the jeweler is William Crescent and his 
phone
number is (708) 418-5075.  He is located in Lansing IL and his address is 
18049 Torrence Ave
Lansing, IL  60438

Let him know I recommended him and if he doesn't remember me tell him I was 
referred
by Greg Penmann and Mike Curry.  They both bought their engagement rings from 
Bill.

He's a pretty cool guy so just tell him what your looking for in terms of 
cut, clarity, color,
and carat.  He'll receive a number of stones that fit your description and 
describe them
over the phone.  He should encourage you to shop his prices.  I found him to 
be very
competitive.  Let me know how it goes.

Are you available to meet next Tuesday afternoon around 4pm.  Let me know.

Kevin

You're correct, I am saddened to see such a great x-Philly treated so 
poorly.  I often look back 
with wonder at how much ground Stocker would cover at the shortstop position, 
not to mention
his tremendous power for a man of such small stature.  He could only be 
compared to x-Philly
and future hall of famer - Ivan DeJesus.  The only uncertainty is whether or 
not Ivan will elect
to be inducted under the Philly or Cubs uniform.

On the house front,  we purchased one and moved in at the beginning of May.  
It's a fixer-upper.
All our weekends are spent working on it.

I gotta run, but thanks for the email.  Let me know how everything is going 
in your world.  Tell
Rina and the kids we said hi.

Thanks for the picture.  I'm glad you guys like the gift.  Luke looks just 
like Rena, huh?

As far as Ricigs goes, I don't have his phone # or address.  I think Moller 
does though.
Let me know  if you need his #.  Take care and tell Rena and Luke we said hi.

delayed response,
I seem to check my emails around once every 2 weeks.  I hope you could make 
it out.  I'll check

Let me know.

Kelly,

I spoke with my friend and he mentioned that Michael was already talking to 2 
firms and he
didn't want to recommend a third at this time.  I told him that if anything 
changes, let me know.
It was worth a try anyway.  I'll talk to you soon.

That would be great.  Let me know so I could get tix to a ballgame if the 
Astros are in town that weekend.
I'm going to the game next Monday to see McGwire and the Cards.  Glad to hear 
everything's going well.

I got a call from Peremes on Saturday.  She heard I got engaged and was 
pissed I didn't tell her.  I think she's
smoking serious crack 'cause I told her when I talked to her about 6 mos. 
ago.  I guess she just chose to ignore
me as usual.

Talk to you soon.

KR

P.S.  We just closed on a house this past Friday.  It's in need of some 
serious work.  Hopefully it'll be
habitable by the time you see it.

Chump,

Long time no hear.  Sorry it's taken me so long to touch base with you.  
Between work, the wedding,
and the fact that we just purchased a house (pending inspections) I've been 
pretty stressed.
As far as the wedding goes Lisa and I have decided to scale down 
considerably.  We're only going
to have immediately family and the folks in the wedding party.  For me that 
includes you of course, Moller,
Kampy and Peremes (even though she won't be in the wedding).  Don't tell her 
though, she's the only
one I haven't mentioned anything to.  I'll make sure you and Moller get to 
share a room.  I feel kinda bad
about not inviting Lowery since I was in his wedding, but I don't feel like 
dealing with Kim.  She's really 
annoyed me the last few times I've seen her.

We still plan on having it at the B&B in Long Beach Island.  We'll have a 
catered dinner for about 45 folks.
It should be more manageable and cheaper this way.

Do you have the exact date when you'll move back to the states?  I'm psyched 
you'll be a lot closer.  You
could swing over to Houston and check out the new house.  By that time we 
should have it in decent shape.
We bought the ugliest, most beat-up house on the block.  It definitely needs 
a lot of work.  We'll be busy for
the next year working on it.  I think when it's done,  it'll look pretty cool.

Anyway,  send me an email and let me know how everything's going and when 
you'll be back.  Take care and
tell Marie we said hi.

Congrats Murli,

Sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you.  I'm glad you accepted a job 
at Enron.
I know you'll enjoy it.  As far as ECI goes, what group is this?  Is this the 
Communications
group?  I would not recommend EES however.  I think you're experience would 
be better
at ECT (now ENA) or Enron Communications.   Give me a call at 713-853-6320 
(W) and
we can talk.  Also I'm still in an apt so I don't know any real estate 
brokers to refer you to.

Talk to you soon.

Dave,

It was great getting a chance to finanlly meet the other night.  Hope you 
enjoyed dinner.

Since then, I've been thinking abt some of our conversation re: the PBR.  I 
have a quick
question - why wouldn't you under withdraw in Feb and over withdraw in Mar if 
Mar is currently
higher than Feb.  You could lock this in by buying Mar forward.  Also,  what 
happens if you
withdraw in Mar and the Summer peaks higher than what you withdrew at?  How 
is this accounted
for?

I'll talk to you after you get back from Houston.

You gotta get more current jokes.  That one's been floating around for quite 
some
time now.  How's everything in SF?  Have you moved into your new office?

Leroy,

Thanks for the email.  Sorry it took so long to get back to you - I actually 
am just catching up
with my emails now - Friday at 5pm.  I'm interested in talking to you about

Great to hear from you as always.  It'll be great to have you 
back in the states.  By the way, I attached a copy of the boys.
I hope it comes across OK.

Talk to you soon.

Great to hear from you.  Things have been going well in Houston.  Lisa is 
working for Johnson Controls.
It must be a long time since we've talked b/c she's been with Johnson for 
about 5 months.  I love my
new job - I'm trading gas up in the Midwest market area - Illinois and 
Michigan.  Things have been 
incredibly busy.

The wedding plans have changed considerably.  As I'm sure you can relate to, 
the stress of planning 
combined with the input of so many others have made us decide to have a 
wedding with only our folks 
there and not even have a reception.   We figured we could put the money 
toward a house and save
a lot of anger, frustration and stress.

How's the job, new house, and Terri doing?  Have you been to many Bears 
games?  The Scarlet Knights
have been so inconsistent this year.  I think a lot is due to their youth.

Let's talk soon.

Kevin

Stacy,

Kevin Ruscitti has requested a secondary firm ANR ML7 phy gas product for EOL.  I have located some language that you and Dale worked on back in May of 2000.  Please let me know if this language will be OK for our needs.  Also, will the current GTC for Phy gas need to be revised in any way?

Thanks,

A US Gas Transaction with Enron North America Corp., under which Seller shall sell and Buyer shall purchase a quantity of natural gas equal to the Daily Contract Quantity at the Contract Price on a secondary firm basis. The Contract Price shall be as submitted by Counterparty via the Website.  The Period of Delivery shall be from the Effective Date through the Termination Date.
The term of the Transaction shall correspond to the date(s) set forth in the Product description on the Website.
The transaction is for delivery at the ANR Pipeline Company ML7 interconnect.  The volumes scheduled to be delivered are subject to reductions due to normal operational constraints on the ANR  Pipeline Company pipelines based upon historical operating conditions.  The reductions caused by these constraints are excused nonperformance and are not considered a failure to receive or deliver firm gas.  In the event that the volumes scheduled are reduced due to such normal operational constraints, Buyer may designate a secondary firm delivery location.
The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the Contractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be millions of British thermal units and the quantity shown shall be in millions of BTUs per day.

If I understand you correctly, it may depend to an extent on season basis

Why don't you give me a call so I could better understand what you're trying

T.J.,

I need your LA address.  I'm sure I have it some place but I can't find it.
How's everything going?  How's Rena?  Are you heading home for the 
holidays or staying in LA?

Also,  if you have Lowery's address and phone # could you forward it.

Thanks,

Of course your Dad would be invited to anything we do, but if you'd rather 
spend the
time alone with him that weekend we could always make it another weekend.  
The only
problem with the 12th is that we'll be consumed with the move the entire 
weekend.  Let
me know what works for you.  We're flexible after the 12th.

The 12th isn't good for me b/c we're moving.   Any other weekend should be OK 
though.

I'll tell you what.  You give us your "want"  list and we'll make sure you 
can do it all.
Of course, after you assemble the chair.

Subject: Secondary firm delivery

Stacy,

Kevin Ruscitti has requested a secondary firm ANR ML7 phy gas product for 
EOL.  I have located some language that you and Dale worked on back in May of 
2000.  Please let me know if this language will be OK for our needs.  Also, 
will the current GTC for Phy gas need to be revised in any way?

Thanks,

CW

A US Gas Transaction with Enron North America Corp., under which Seller shall 
sell and Buyer shall purchase a quantity of natural gas equal to the Daily 
Contract Quantity at the Contract Price on a secondary firm basis. The 
Contract Price shall be as submitted by Counterparty via the Website.  The 
Period of Delivery shall be from the Effective Date through the Termination 
Date.
The term of the Transaction shall correspond to the date(s) set forth in the 
Product description on the Website.
The transaction is for delivery at the ANR Pipeline Company ML7 
interconnect.  The volumes scheduled to be delivered are subject to 
reductions due to normal operational constraints on the ANR  Pipeline Company 
pipelines based upon historical operating conditions.  The reductions caused 
by these constraints are excused nonperformance and are not considered a 
failure to receive or deliver firm gas.  In the event that the volumes 
scheduled are reduced due to such normal operational constraints, Buyer may 
designate a secondary firm delivery location.
The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the 
Contractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be millions of 
British thermal units and the quantity shown shall be in millions of BTUs per 
day.

Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

We'll just be doing some house shopping.  I think we're going to postpone the 
upgrade to
the existing house and look to buy a new house.  This would eliminate the 
need to move
out for 6 months.  I'm dying to live in a house that is complete.  Anyway, 
besides this we
don't seem to have much going on.  I'll just need to go into work for a few 
hours on Sunday.

Let me know what you want to do.

You're correct, Enron doesn't get too involved in these conventions.  I don't 
know 
why.  It seems that some of the desks have some functions but mine never 
does.   My desk
seems to be pretty apathetic (probably not a good thing).  I think we've 
relied, more than
any of our other desks, on the financial and e-commerce sides of the 
business.  Probably
not a great thing.  Anyway, lets get together for a cocktail or dinner 
sometime within the 
next month.  Did you guys move to the Galleria location yet.  Let me know - 
we'll go get 
a big steak at Morton's or Ruths' Chris.  I assume a country boy like you is 
into some
good red meat.

Stamos, 

Glad everyone had a good time at Sweets'.  I hope he had a blast.

In terms of your email reply,
you can have Calpine.  How are they going to make money long term if price 
caps are instituted?  This obviously would be the stupidest policy.  In 
addition
their exposure to the CA crisis must be pretty significant - when and how are 
they
going to get paid?  I wouldn't want to bank on the energy market in the most 
regulated state in the country.  Plus, if the state backs energy purchases, 
it's 
going to get to the point where who wants to own CA credit??  PG&E and Edison
International are doomed, as they should be.  The state of CA is going to go
down the tubes unless they find some good leadership.  Unfortunately, noone
out there seems to have the least clue on how to solve the problem.  The 
politicians
are a complete joke.  It is incredibly disheartening to witness the absolute 
stupidity
of the CA politicians in addressing this issue.  They seem to be much more 
focused 
on finger pointing than coming up with a viable solution.  I honestly think 
they are incable
of solving the problem.

Stamos,

I don't think many buying opportunities out there.   The economy is going to 
get 
crushed this year.  There's only one place to put one's money now, and that 
is in cash.
The manufacturing sector is in dire straits and you will continue to see an 
increase in
plant shutdowns and company layoffs.  The Fed could continue to lower rates 
but there'll
be little capital investment if consumer spending dries up.  I feel we've 
just seen the beginning.  
I think the Dow will be trading under 8000 by the end of April.

Psychologically, the California crisis will add to consumer fear.  The crisis 
is not a short term
problem.  As a result, barring any Federal bailout, you could kiss that 
state's economy goodbye.
Let me ask you a question; if you were paying (1) the highest real estate 
prices in the country, and 
(2) the highest energy prices for the least reliable power, in (3) the midst 
of a hi-tech meltdown, what would
keep you or your company from closing shop and moving to a different state??  
If you own any
CA real estate, sell.  The only way to solve the CA energy crisis is to 
reduce demand or increase supply.
Since CA doesn't want any power plants in its backyard, the supply issue 
likely won't be solved anytime
soon.  So, how do impact demand??  You have to price energy(power/gas) so 
high that
the discretionary user (household, manufacturer, commercial store) conserves 
by closing its plant, cutting
back on the thermastat or running the commercial operation during off-peak 
hours.  California will see
this reduction in demand over time.  If the blackouts subside it's because so 
many businesses have
closed their doors for good or moved to another state.  Without this, the 
blackouts will get much worse.
If the state tries to get into the business of buying and selling electricity 
and gas, I would bet it will go
bankrupt within 2-3 yrs.  Could you imagine the impact on the national 
economy from the bankruptcy 
of the U.S.'s most prosperous state.  Obviously this is only my opinion, but 
I would keep my eyes on
the energy markets - that's where the key to the turnaround lies.  Take Care 
and thanks for the email.

That state will never be the same.  My prediction is that the state will be
bankrupt within the next 2 years unless the Federal Gov't bails it out.  I 
hope
Lowery has held off on buying his house.

Talk to you this weekend.  I blew off the Montana trip so I'll be home.

Great to hear from you.  Looking forward to meeting in Houston for a baseball 
game.
Conway will be in Corpis soon so we should be able to do a weekend.  We 
should start
construction on the house in May - what an incredibly long process it is.  I 
definitely would
not do it if I had to do it over again.  One redeeming factor is that we 
bought on a good 
block.  We definitely have the ugliest house on the block.  We should get a 
pop in real
estate also when all the California companies start migrating to Texas.  

Joking aside, unless you guys have incredibly mild weather this summer 
combined with
a lot of rainfall, you're summer will suck.  There is no doubt that the CA 
economy is going
to suffer a great recession.  You have a shortage of supply so the only way 
to ease the
problem is to reduce demand.  This usually occurs when prices reach levels 
where the price
sensitive buyers cut back.  However, with your boy Grey Davis pushing for  
price caps, this won't
happen.   The next way for demand to be trimmed is for companies to leave, so 
this will probably
need to happen to an extent for the problem to ease.  The other factor, of 
course, is that you
could have an increase in supply - new power plants.  But being that the amt. 
of time it takes to 
develop and build a power plant in CA is about 3 times as long as in most 
other states combined
with the fact that CA hasn't had a new power plant in the last 10 years, an 
increase in supply
doesn't seem likely in the short term.  Again, this is only my opinion, so 
you could take it with
a grain of salt.  

Talk to you soon.

Kevin

BL,

Have you experienced any blackouts yet?  I think you'll see a lot this summer.
What does everyone think about the situation?  Do they think it's a threat or 
not?  I think
the state is in for a horrific summer - I hope it doesn't turn out that way, 
but it'll be incredibly
difficult to avoid.

Hope everything's going well with work and with the family.  When's the next 
time you'll
be in Dallas?  Let me know.

Subject:=09Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new=
 building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being o=
ffered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the=
 new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The =
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is cu=
rrently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly empl=
oyee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name =
to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be m=
ade as spaces become available.=20

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be op=
ened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street lev=
el entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Ga=
rage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an=
 exit in the event of elevator trouble.=20

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Pa=
rking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your em=
ail, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and=
 receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the =
new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and=
 Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions.=20

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, w=
ill have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.=
)

Jen,

Great to hear from you.  Early congrats on your graduation.  Everything has 
been
going well down in the Lone Star State.  I got married in September down the 
Jersey
shore and everything has been going well.  We bought a house back in May.  It 
needs
an incredible amount of work.  We own the ugliest house on the block, by far.

How are things in Indiana?  Are you and Paul still together?  How is he 
doing?  When
is the last time you were back in Jersey?  We went back over Christmas but 
only for
a couple days.  I think next year we'll go back during New Year's instead of 
Christmas.
If you ever get near Texas or pass through Houston, please give us a call.  
You both
are always welcome to stay at our house.  My phone # is (713) 880-4157.  My 
work
# is (713) 853-6320.  Hope to hear from you soon.

Kevin

We'll just be doing some house shopping.  I think we're going to postpone the upgrade to
the existing house and look to buy a new house.  This would eliminate the need to move
out for 6 months.  I'm dying to live in a house that is complete.  Anyway, besides this we
don't seem to have much going on.  I'll just need to go into work for a few hours on Sunday.

Let me know what you want to do.

The following article appeared in today's Chronicle.

Enron rating setup irks many workers 
By L.M. SIXEL 

TONGUES ARE WAGGING at Enron Corp., and it's not because of the bonuses 
they're expecting next month. 

Employees are irate about a new performance-review ranking system that pits 
them against each other. 

Under the system, nicknamed "rank and yank," employees will be put in one of 
five categories: 5 percent will be identified as "superior," 30 percent will 
be labeled "excellent," 30 percent will be called "strong," 20 percent will 
be labeled "satisfactory" and 15 percent will be called "needs improvement" 
or "issues." 

An insider said "needs improvement" means "you have one leg hanging out the 
window." And "issues" is Enron lingo for "you're gone." 

The rankings, whose names reportedly took Enron officials hours to come up 
with, are not based just on performance. 

Instead, they compare employee against employee. 

"It is possible, therefore, for someone to perform at the same or higher 
level compared to prior periods, yet receive a lower rating for the current 
period if other employees' performance raised the bar," according to a memo 
from Chief of Staff Steven Kean and Executive Vice President Cindy Olson that 
was distributed this month. 

While employees are competing against each other for ratings, they're also 
expected to be team players, according to the memo. 


`Horse-trading' of rank denied
The problem, according to someone familiar with the new system, is the 
horse-trading that goes on when the rankings are divided up. 

Managers trade rankings like baseball cards, explained the insider, offering 
to downgrade one employee if they can get a better rating for another 
employee. 

An employee's ranking is more a function of the negotiating skills of the 
manager he is working for, the insider said. 

Olson, who's over human resources and community relations, said no 
horsetrading is going on. The rankings, due out this week, aren't set in 
stone, she said. Only 9 percent of employees were rated in the bottom 
category while 6 to 7 percent were labeled superior, she said. 

But Olson said she can see how employees might be worried about the prospect 
of bargaining. 

She speculated that one reason employees might worry is because it's a new 
system for about 60 percent of Enron's employees. In years past, only the 
wholesale energy services group was ranked this way. 

Some human resource managers expressed surprise that Enron, which is known 
for hiring superstars, apparently feels that it must get rid of so many 
employees -- or at least put them on notice that they're not doing well. 

It doesn't say much about the confidence of your recruiting system if you're 
getting rid of 10 to 15 percent of your work force each year, said a human 
resource manager in Houston who asked to remain anonymous. 


Some may not fit in
Some people, as smart and talented as they are, just don't fit into Enron's 
culture, Olson said. It's a company that doesn't tell people what to do; you 
have to know what adds value, she said. Some folks just have a hard time in 
that environment. 

After thinking about it for a moment, Olson added that maybe Enron's 
recruiters aren't doing a good enough job weeding out the people who wouldn't 
do well in an entrepreneurial environment. 

Forced ranking systems were popular several years ago. But they fell out of 
favor, in part because they were seen as damaging employee motivation. 

Several years ago, Houston Lighting & Power put in a forced ranking system, 
dividing all employees into four groups, with "1" the top group and "4" the 
lowest. Employees were so angry with the system that some work crews had 
T-shirts printed: "Don't ask me -- I'm a 3." 

Olson said she doesn't see a problem with motivation. People like to know how 
they stand and will work hard to reach the top category, she said. 

But many of the employees -- at least the ones who rate above satisfactory -- 
won't know how they're rated. Managers don't have to reveal the ratings. 

And as for figuring out what it takes to be superior? You've got to reinvent 
your job, add new business lines or create something totally new. 

"Employees understand that when it's explained to them," Olson said.

Correction,  I don't think thinks will blow over this summer, I think things 
could blow
up and actually be a lot worse than they are now.  In terms of longer term, I 
think
a lot depends on how the state tries to resolve the problem.  It will be 
interesting to
see.  I feel that the summer will be very interesting, especially if 
California gets the
kind of heat they had last summer.  Stay in touch.

The house thing is a tough call.  It's hard to say.   If you're not in any 
hurry to buy, the summer should give
you a good indication of continuing energy problems.  I personally think that 
the problem will come and go 
for a while, but a lot depends on how California's legislature deals with the 
situation.  I have no idea what 
they'll end up doing - they've acted pretty poorly already.

What's your time frame on a house?  If you're only concern is that prices are 
at their highest level in the last 
decade, I wouldn't worry too much about that.  It's impossible to time the 
market -  who would've thought 
San Francisco's housing prices would be at these current levels.   There are 
also a lot of intangibles associated 
with home ownership as your aware of.   

I would be concerned about the energy situation, so just try to keep abreast 
of it.  Also, you could call me if you
have any questions.  I'll try to help the best I can.  Take care and tell Kim 
and Kendall I said hi.

Kevin

Chump!
This energy crisis is making me question  my timing on buying a house.  I'm
thinking if the economy tanks the housing prices will dip a little.  They
just crack the highs of 1989 this last two years.  Any opinions?

I start my Texas travel in February.  I'll be in Dallas for the first full
week and back in March in Dallas again.  Starting the end of March I'll be
there almost every week for about 6 months.  You'll be seeing more of me than
you want.  When we get closer to March I'll give you a buzz to set up some
dates.
Sorry about the Kendall picture, I'll try again.

Take care, B

Mr. B. Lowery,

First of all, you sent me a picture with the head cut off.  I couldn't even 
see Kendall.
I don't know if something happened with the translation of the file, but try 
to send
it again if you can.  

In regards to California's energy crisis, I think that California is screwed 
- big time.
I think it has the potential to cripple the state's economy.  If, like you 
said, noone 
really talks about it much in SoCal, I would bet that will change soon.  It 
has the potential
to affect every person in the state.  Not only will consumers end up bailing 
out the
utilities - SoCal Edison, San Diego, Gas and Electric, PG&E - but it will 
likely prevent
many new companies from setting up shop in California.  After all, who would 
want
to put millions of dollars in an operation that will be subject to power 
interruptions 
while paying the highest utility bills in the country.  I think that the only 
way California
will come out of this OK, is if it has the least energy intensive weather for 
the foreseeable
future.  I don't think this is a problem that will be resolved within the 
next couple years.
But remember, that is just my meaningless opinion.

When do you start coming to Texas.  Let me know so we can try to hook up.  
I'll talk to
you soon.

Of course your Dad would be invited to anything we do, but if you'd rather spend the
time alone with him that weekend we could always make it another weekend.  The only
problem with the 12th is that we'll be consumed with the move the entire weekend.  Let
me know what works for you.  We're flexible after the 12th.

You're correct, Enron doesn't get too involved in these conventions.  I don't know 
why.  It seems that some of the desks have some functions but mine never does.   My desk
seems to be pretty apathetic (probably not a good thing).  I think we've relied, more than
any of our other desks, on the financial and e-commerce sides of the business.  Probably
not a great thing.  Anyway, lets get together for a cocktail or dinner sometime within the 
next month.  Did you guys move to the Galleria location yet.  Let me know - we'll go get 
a big steak at Morton's or Ruths' Chris.  I assume a country boy like you is into some
good red meat.

Julie,

If they want to pay $5.15, that's fine with me.  I do have $5.11 in the 
system but I could
have easily made a mistake.  Let me know if you have any other questions.

Kevin

P.S.  Sorry it took me so long to reply.

Stamos, 

Glad everyone had a good time at Sweets'.  I hope he had a blast.

In terms of your email reply,
you can have Calpine.  How are they going to make money long term if price 
caps are instituted?  This obviously would be the stupidest policy.  In addition
their exposure to the CA crisis must be pretty significant - when and how are they
going to get paid?  I wouldn't want to bank on the energy market in the most 
regulated state in the country.  Plus, if the state backs energy purchases, it's 
going to get to the point where who wants to own CA credit??  PG&E and Edison
International are doomed, as they should be.  The state of CA is going to go
down the tubes unless they find some good leadership.  Unfortunately, noone
out there seems to have the least clue on how to solve the problem.  The politicians
are a complete joke.  It is incredibly disheartening to witness the absolute stupidity
of the CA politicians in addressing this issue.  They seem to be much more focused 
on finger pointing than coming up with a viable solution.  I honestly think they are incable
of solving the problem.

Stamos,

I don't think many buying opportunities out there.   The economy is going to get 
crushed this year.  There's only one place to put one's money now, and that is in cash.
The manufacturing sector is in dire straits and you will continue to see an increase in
plant shutdowns and company layoffs.  The Fed could continue to lower rates but there'll
be little capital investment if consumer spending dries up.  I feel we've just seen the beginning.  
I think the Dow will be trading under 8000 by the end of April.

Psychologically, the California crisis will add to consumer fear.  The crisis is not a short term
problem.  As a result, barring any Federal bailout, you could kiss that state's economy goodbye.
Let me ask you a question; if you were paying (1) the highest real estate prices in the country, and 
(2) the highest energy prices for the least reliable power, in (3) the midst of a hi-tech meltdown, what would
keep you or your company from closing shop and moving to a different state??  If you own any
CA real estate, sell.  The only way to solve the CA energy crisis is to reduce demand or increase supply.
Since CA doesn't want any power plants in its backyard, the supply issue likely won't be solved anytime
soon.  So, how do impact demand??  You have to price energy(power/gas) so high that
the discretionary user (household, manufacturer, commercial store) conserves by closing its plant, cutting
back on the thermastat or running the commercial operation during off-peak hours.  California will see
this reduction in demand over time.  If the blackouts subside it's because so many businesses have
closed their doors for good or moved to another state.  Without this, the blackouts will get much worse.
If the state tries to get into the business of buying and selling electricity and gas, I would bet it will go
bankrupt within 2-3 yrs.  Could you imagine the impact on the national economy from the bankruptcy 
of the U.S.'s most prosperous state.  Obviously this is only my opinion, but I would keep my eyes on
the energy markets - that's where the key to the turnaround lies.  Take Care and thanks for the email.

That state will never be the same.  My prediction is that the state will be
bankrupt within the next 2 years unless the Federal Gov't bails it out.  I hope
Lowery has held off on buying his house.

Talk to you this weekend.  I blew off the Montana trip so I'll be home.

Great to hear from you.  Looking forward to meeting in Houston for a baseball game.
Conway will be in Corpis soon so we should be able to do a weekend.  We should start
construction on the house in May - what an incredibly long process it is.  I definitely would
not do it if I had to do it over again.  One redeeming factor is that we bought on a good 
block.  We definitely have the ugliest house on the block.  We should get a pop in real
estate also when all the California companies start migrating to Texas.  

Joking aside, unless you guys have incredibly mild weather this summer combined with
a lot of rainfall, you're summer will suck.  There is no doubt that the CA economy is going
to suffer a great recession.  You have a shortage of supply so the only way to ease the
problem is to reduce demand.  This usually occurs when prices reach levels where the price
sensitive buyers cut back.  However, with your boy Grey Davis pushing for  price caps, this won't
happen.   The next way for demand to be trimmed is for companies to leave, so this will probably
need to happen to an extent for the problem to ease.  The other factor, of course, is that you
could have an increase in supply - new power plants.  But being that the amt. of time it takes to 
develop and build a power plant in CA is about 3 times as long as in most other states combined
with the fact that CA hasn't had a new power plant in the last 10 years, an increase in supply
doesn't seem likely in the short term.  Again, this is only my opinion, so you could take it with
a grain of salt.  

Talk to you soon.

BL,

Have you experienced any blackouts yet?  I think you'll see a lot this summer.
What does everyone think about the situation?  Do they think it's a threat or not?  I think
the state is in for a horrific summer - I hope it doesn't turn out that way, but it'll be incredibly
difficult to avoid.

Hope everything's going well with work and with the family.  When's the next time you'll
be in Dallas?  Let me know.

They appear to have made the changes that we requested.  Do you want me to 
fill in the name of the Seller and print off 2 originals for signature.  If 
not, please fill in the name and forward to me for initialling before the 
contract is signed by ENA..

Subject: Comments concerning Line Pack Gas Purchase Agreement form provided 
by Vector.

Kevin,
 As we discussed, here are the changes I feel need to be made to the form 
before Enron North America Corp.  can agree to use it.

1.  Change 1.1 to read as follows:  This Agreement shall be effective upon 
its execution and shall continue in full force and effect through December 
31, 2000.

2.  Change 3.1 to read as follows:  Upon not less than 36 hours advance 
notification by Vector, Seller shall be obligated to sell and deliver to 
Vector, and Vector shall be obligated to purchase and receive from Seller, at 
the time stipulated by Vector in the advance written notification, at a Point 
of Sale, a quantity of gas equal to Seller's PSQ for such Point of Sale, as 
specified in Exhibit A to this Agreement.  The parties agree that time is of 
the essence in this Agreement..

3.  Add 4.2 to read as follows:  4.2  If Vector fails to purchase and receive 
from Seller the quantity of gas required to be purchased and received by it 
under Article 3.1 for any reason other than the occurrence of an event of 
Force Majeure, Vector shall indemnify Seller and shall be liable to pay 
Seller an amount equal to the difference between the price that would have 
been paid to Seller and the Gas Daily low price, set forth in Gas Daily under 
the heading "Daily Price Survey" under the listing applicable to Chicago and 
using the low price in the range of prices published for the day that Vector 
failed to perform multiplied by the volume Vector failed to purchase and 
receive from Seller for such day.

4.  Add the following language at the end of 9.1.  For breach of any 
provision for which an express remedy or measure of damages is herein 
provided, such express remedy or measure of damages shall be the sole and 
exclusive remedy hereunder.  If no remedy or measure of damages is expressly 
herein provided, the obligor's liability shall be limited to direct actual 
damages only, such direct actual damages shall be the sole and exclusive 
remedy hereunder and all other remedies or damages at law or in equity are 
waived.  Unless expressly herein provided, neither party shall be liable for 
consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or indirect damages, lost 
profits or other business interruption damages, in tort, contract, under any 
indemnity provision or otherwise.

5.  Add the following Seller's information in 10.1.
 Enron North America Corp.
 P. O. Box 4428
 Houston, Texas 77210-4428
 Attn:  Documentation and Deal Clearing Desk
 Facsimile No. (713) 646-4816.

Counnnnnnnnn,

What's up?   I heard Conway emailed you the other day about New Orleans.  I'm 
going to 
meet Conway and Jughead in N.O. on Nov 17 - 19 for a weekend getaway.  I just 
booked
my flight a couple days ago and wanted to see if there was any way you could 
make it
down.  It seems Conway has gotten a cheap hotel room with his military 
discount - one of the
perks of working for Uncle Sam.  I'm sorry for the short notice but we just 
decided to do it a 
few days ago.  If you could make it, we'd all love to see you.  If not, we'll 
have to get together
when I'm in NJ over Christmas.  Tell Chris we said hi.  Hope everything is 
going great for the
both of you.  Talk to you soon.

Sorry it's taken me so long to reply, but I just checked my email.  We were 
out of town the
last few days.  It sounds like you've been doing a lot of thinking and 
reflecting.   I think it healthy
to analyze one's actions in order to better understand oneself.  This better 
understanding, I find,
typically leads to self improvement and greater control, and ultimately, more 
happiness in life.
However, do not let it lead to any form of regret - that would be unfair.  We 
all have regrets, but
these regretted actions typically make us stronger and better people in the 
long run.  

I forwarded your email to Patty Kampmann, not Patti Campi.  As you might 
imagine, I got a kick
out of that.

Talk to you soon.

Kevin

TJ,

Thanks for the congratulatory message you left on our voicemail - it made us 
feel great.
We actually didn't go on a honeymoon - we will take one sometime next year.  
We've just
been swamped with the house we recently bought.  We bought an old small 
bungalow
in the city.  What a money pit.  Hope everything is going great.  Tell 
everyone we said
hi.

Thanks again,

Kevin

The one thing I remember is that they are incredibly expensive and somewhat 
troublesome
to maintain.  Depending on how old it is, I definitely  wouldn't recommend it 
as your primary car.

Hope you had a good time at the wedding.  It was one of the best weekends 
I've had in ages.

Talk to you soon.

I'm glad you had a great time.  It meant a lot to Lisa and me that you were 
able to spend
the entire weekend with us.  I honestly can't remember the last time I had so 
much fun.  I
hope you felt the same way.  Talk to you soon.

I appreciate the email.  I figured something must be wrong for you to miss 
the big day, but I was afraid to call.  The
important thing, obviously, is that you get better.  We'll just have to 
figure out a way to meet up with you in the near
future.  Tell everyone I said hi and keep me informed of your operation and 
recovery.  We'll all miss you very much.

Hugs and Kisses,

Kevin.

P.S.  Tell Tom and John we said hi.

Sounds great.  Moller's email address is Richard.J.Moller@marshmc.com.  I do 
not have anyone else's email,
but Moller should be able to provide you with Coun's and Ricigiliano's.  Just 
ask him.  Let me know if you need anything
else.

Thanks,

Kevin

Hey bro

What is happening?! Fishing stuff is coming along. The charter is set for
Sept. 22nd in the A.M. departing from point pleasant. Capt. Gene will get
back to me in a week or so with more details.

The cost is $50 per person. No bottles allowed but you can bring cans or
cups. I've got the beer and drinks. Also pack food. Trip should be about 8
hours.

Contacted Rich Moeller and let him know about the time and specifics. It
looks like 14 people are going with the possibility of about 20 (5 are still
undecided). Should be a good time.

If you have some e-mail addresses for Rich or Rosigliano or a couple of
other people please supply them to me so I can keep everyone posted on the
details.

The big date is less than 4 weeks away (Can you believe it?)

Hope all is well,

Keith

Please forward this on to Mike and Kevin.  The turnaround time is rather
quick so you probably should contact this person directly to tell him that
you will be coming and sending a check to the address referenced in the
invitation.  Just tell him that you received the invitation from Kara Kinder
Howes (my cousin) and David Kinder.  Kara is one of the hosts of the event.

Alberto,

You're best bet is to send a resume to Chris Gaskill.  Chris is starting a 
new fundamental analysis group.  I know he
is looking for a few more people to get this group off the ground.  If you're 
interested in trading, it's probably the best
way to get involved in this side of the business.  I'm not sure if you have a 
long term interest in trading or if you're just
looking for a rotation.  Give me a call also after 4pm and I could provide 
you with some insight into the area.

Until then send Chris an email with your resume attached or you could talk to 
me first if you'd like.

Kevin

Luke's growing like crazy.  Great to see the update.  Yeah,   the wedding is 
getting near and
the plans are pretty much complete.  We're really just having family so the 
plans at this point are minimum.

How's everything in California.  Is Lowery showing up on your doorstep every 
Sunday at dinner time?  I wouldn't
be surprised.

Did I tell you about the dinner I attended in NY a month ago.  What an 
event.  The party included - get this crew - 
Bill Ricigliano, Dan Sweetser, Jonathan Counnnn, Richie Moller, Brian Sh., 
and yes, Vincent Lima.  We were
all privey to Moller drinking a 12 oz. glass of fresh piss.  Some things 
never change.

Talk to you soon.

Had a great time in SF.  Went to the wine country for a few days.  Was sad to 
come back
to Houston.  We haven't done much on the house since your visit.  I'll talk

Angela,

I'm not looking for another rotation.  I will be staying in NG trading and 
will hopefully be 
getting promoted this PRC session.  Let me know if you have any questions.

It's time to say farewell. Next Thursday will be my last day at Enron, as I 
will be leaving to pursue other opportunities. Over the years, I appreciated 
the opportunity to work with, to learn from and get to know all of you and 
hope we can stay in touch (my email address is finanseer@hotmail.com). I hope 
those in Houston can join me at Solero's after work on Thursday, Sept. 7 
(Deffner's buying!!).

Take care,
Matt

Sounds great.  Moller's email address is Richard.J.Moller@marshmc.com.  I do 
not have anyone else's email,
but Moller should be able to provide you with Coun's and Ricigiliano's.  Just 
ask him.  Let me know if you need anything
else.

Thanks,

Kevin

Hey bro

What is happening?! Fishing stuff is coming along. The charter is set for
Sept. 22nd in the A.M. departing from point pleasant. Capt. Gene will get
back to me in a week or so with more details.

The cost is $50 per person. No bottles allowed but you can bring cans or
cups. I've got the beer and drinks. Also pack food. Trip should be about 8
hours.

Contacted Rich Moeller and let him know about the time and specifics. It
looks like 14 people are going with the possibility of about 20 (5 are still
undecided). Should be a good time.

If you have some e-mail addresses for Rich or Rosigliano or a couple of
other people please supply them to me so I can keep everyone posted on the
details.

The big date is less than 4 weeks away (Can you believe it?)

Hope all is well,

Keith

Ahn-yong-ha-sae-yo Anderson team,
Looks like I'll be missing the fall recruiting activities in L.A.  I trust 
all is going well, and that we should continue our success at Anderson.  I 
would hope the dot com fever has died down somewhat, plus I think Enron has 
quite of bit of upside to offer candidates in that so much of what we do now 
is new economy without as much risk as a pure dot com.

Life in Seoul is working out quite nicely.   My wife Sunnie and I are finally 
settled into our townhouse in Sungbuk-dong, next to Pukhansan National 
Park.   Almost all of Korea is mountainous and we can find trails everywhere 
in and around Seoul.  Work is going very well.   I'm in charge of new 
business development at the SK-Enron joint venture so I've got my team 
working on about half a dozen initiatives.  I am currently busy preparing for 
the launch of a B2C website catering to consumers and their household 
needs.   I'm also leading a pilot project to lay some fiber optic cable along 
our gas pipeline network.  Summer monsoons have finally stopped, and we're 
looking forward to a trip down to Pusan during Chuseok (Korean 
thanksgiving).  Sunnie, daughter Heather and I spent a week in the mountains 
near Seoul, quite beautiful.    Let me know how the recruiting progresses, 
and also what's been going on in Houston.  

Cheers,
Jung

Hey bro

What is happening?! Fishing stuff is coming along. The charter is set for
Sept. 22nd in the A.M. departing from point pleasant. Capt. Gene will get
back to me in a week or so with more details.

The cost is $50 per person. No bottles allowed but you can bring cans or
cups. I've got the beer and drinks. Also pack food. Trip should be about 8
hours.

Contacted Rich Moeller and let him know about the time and specifics. It
looks like 14 people are going with the possibility of about 20 (5 are still
undecided). Should be a good time.

If you have some e-mail addresses for Rich or Rosigliano or a couple of
other people please supply them to me so I can keep everyone posted on the
details.

The big date is less than 4 weeks away (Can you believe it?)

Hope all is well,

Keith

Please forward this on to Mike and Kevin.  The turnaround time is rather
quick so you probably should contact this person directly to tell him that
you will be coming and sending a check to the address referenced in the
invitation.  Just tell him that you received the invitation from Kara Kinder
Howes (my cousin) and David Kinder.  Kara is one of the hosts of the event.

Alberto,

You're best bet is to send a resume to Chris Gaskill.  Chris is starting a 
new fundamental analysis group.  I know he
is looking for a few more people to get this group off the ground.  If you're 
interested in trading, it's probably the best
way to get involved in this side of the business.  I'm not sure if you have a 
long term interest in trading or if you're just
looking for a rotation.  Give me a call also after 4pm and I could provide 
you with some insight into the area.

Until then send Chris an email with your resume attached or you could talk to 
me first if you'd like.

Kevin

Stacey - 

Below are two e-mails sent to you on their respective dates. I think we are 
ready to push on with the ANR ML7 Delivery Location and have suggested some 
language based on comments from Kevin (e-mail dated 5-12). Kevin has called 
and asked for this product. Please offer comments/approval.


5/31/00

I spoke with Mark Schrab in Logistics about the ANR ML7 Product that Kevin 
Ruscettit would like to start trading and he wasn't able to dispell any 
beliefs that this is a product that should not be traded, OTC or otherwise.

Mark explained that often times on this pipe there were cuts due to 
operational constraints. I explained that we had drafted language to 
contemplate these occurances. I then asked Mark what would happen if there 
was a cut due to op constraints, and Mark explained that he would try to find 
another Buyer along the pipe. I probed further, and found that there would be 
no revision of the contract, nor a re-pricing of the transaction due to the 
re-scheduling. I then read Mark the language under consideration (making sure 
he understood that this was conceptual) and he agreed that the language 
provided for something that we are already doing operationally. Mark had 
never seen the language we propse for use for this Product. 

I think Logistics may have been issuing an opinion on their point without 
being fully aware of what we were attempting to offer, and I certainly don't 
blame them for doing so - as we all make decisions based on the information 
at hand.

I would like to proceed with this Product.

Dale

5/12/00

I spoke with Kevin Ruscetti, the trader, and Kevin has clarified for me that 
the product he intends to trade on ANR ML7 is NOT Interruptable gas, but 
rather subject to operational constraints like Socal Topock. He did request, 
however, that we make reference to secondary firm delivery.

Below please find the op constraints language that we use. I also added a 
secondary delivery blurb; please feel free to edit - and then I'll get this 
in front of Kevin for his review.


The transaction is for delivery at the ANR Pipeline Company ML7 
interconnect.  The volumes scheduled to be 
delivered are subject to reductions due to normal operational constraints on 
the ANR Pipeline Company pipelines 
based upon historical operating conditions.  The reductions caused by these 
constraints are excused 
nonperformance and are not considered a failure to receive or deliver firm 
gas. In the event that the volumes 
scheduled are reduced due to such normal operational constraints occur, Buyer 
may designate 
a secondary firm delivery location.

Hey Kevin,
We understand you will be coming home in a few weeks.
Do you know the exact date, or did my husband just not tell me?
I'm testing out my email ability since Lisa was able to give me your address
last night.
We're glad to hear all is going well and the the house will be completed
sooner than expected!

Enjoy the heat!!!! Gloria

Luke's growing like crazy.  Great to see the update.  Yeah,   the wedding is 
getting near and
the plans are pretty much complete.  We're really just having family so the 
plans at this point are minimum.

How's everything in California.  Is Lowery showing up on your doorstep every 
Sunday at dinner time?  I wouldn't
be surprised.

Did I tell you about the dinner I attended in NY a month ago.  What an 
event.  The party included - get this crew - 
Bill Ricigliano, Dan Sweetser, Jonathan Counnnn, Richie Moller, Brian Sh., 
and yes, Vincent Lima.  We were
all privey to Moller drinking a 12 oz. glass of fresh piss.  Some things 
never change.

Talk to you soon.

Dude,
Didn't really have a chance to tell you how great it was to see you again. It 
was way too long and we should not wait another three years to get together 
again. I can promise you that Mr. Moller will not be drinking piss the next 
time we are out. I don't have your work number, so why don't you send it to 
me or call me in the office at 973 367-7150. Tell Lisa I send my best and let 
me know the next time you are back in Jersey with some time to kill.

Had a great time in SF.  Went to the wine country for a few days.  Was sad to 
come back
to Houston.  We haven't done much on the house since your visit.  I'll talk

Angela,

I'm not looking for another rotation.  I will be staying in NG trading and 
will hopefully be 
getting promoted this PRC session.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Good to hear from you.  The name of the jeweler is William Crescent and his 
phone
number is (708) 418-5075.  He is located in Lansing IL and his address is 
18049 Torrence Ave
Lansing, IL  60438

Let him know I recommended him and if he doesn't remember me tell him I was 
referred
by Greg Penmann and Mike Curry.  They both bought their engagement rings from 
Bill.

He's a pretty cool guy so just tell him what your looking for in terms of 
cut, clarity, color,
and carat.  He'll receive a number of stones that fit your description and 
describe them
over the phone.  He should encourage you to shop his prices.  I found him to 
be very
competitive.  Let me know how it goes.

Are you available to meet next Tuesday afternoon around 4pm.  Let me know.

Kevin

Hi Everyone,

I know that there is a whole bunch of you on the receiving end of this EMail
and we haven't seen or spoken to some in quite awhile but know this -- we are
thinking of you and your families!!  Our little (big?) Luke turned 4 months
today so I thought I would share some photos with all of you.  Although we 
have
been guilty of not staying in touch, I hope that the attached photos will 
allow
us to somewhat catch up with you.  It is certainly all about Luke on this end
of the line.  He is happy, healthy and so is Mom and Dad.  Here is hoping that
all is well on your end.  We hope to see everyone soon again some day but 
until
then we wish everyone all the best!

Love,

Todd, Rena, and Luke

You're correct, I am saddened to see such a great x-Philly treated so 
poorly.  I often look back 
with wonder at how much ground Stocker would cover at the shortstop position, 
not to mention
his tremendous power for a man of such small stature.  He could only be 
compared to x-Philly
and future hall of famer - Ivan DeJesus.  The only uncertainty is whether or 
not Ivan will elect
to be inducted under the Philly or Cubs uniform.

On the house front,  we purchased one and moved in at the beginning of May.  
It's a fixer-upper.
All our weekends are spent working on it.

I gotta run, but thanks for the email.  Let me know how everything is going 
in your world.  Tell
Rina and the kids we said hi.

Kevin,

I recently saw that a Team Thadeus (fantasy baseball) original and one time
Philly - Kevin Stocker was cut by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.  I'm sure you
were saddened to see one of the better players the Phillies put out at
shortstop get treated so rudely.  I hope all is well with Lisa and the
dogs.  What's the latest with the house hunting and the wedding plans?

Everyone here says hello.

Thanks.

Paul

David,

Could you take a few minutes to review the attached new location EPNG 
NonBondad.  Tori Kuykendall from the west desk has told us she wants the same 
language that SoCal Topock has due to the fact that the EPNG NonBondad 
section of the pipeline has a history of breaking down and being interrupted 
all the time.  

Thank you,

Melba

Existing:
EPNG SoCal Topock
The transaction is for delivery at the Southern California Gas Company -  
Topock interconnect with El Paso Natural Gas.  The volumes scheduled to be 
delivered are subject to reductions due to normal operational constraints on 
both El Paso Natural Gas and Southern California Gas Company pipelines based 
upon historical operating conditions.  The reductions caused by these 
constraints are excused nonperformance and are not considered a failure to 
receive or deliver firm gas.

Kevin Ruscetti would like to trade Physical Index transactions for delivery 
to ANR ML7 based on the above referenced Index. He tells me that it is widely 
known that delivery at ANR ML7 is secondary firm, and states that if allowed 
to transact on this the language would need to state that the parties would 
employ their 'best efforts' to deliver.

Joe - can you try and find me some Confirm language for this.

Comments, please.

Alliance presented this to PGL when they were here on Tuesday (its the firm 
shippers primary deliver points).As an interesting note PGL interconnect will 
allow 600, but their system can't handle it.  We're working with our Canadian 
office to "buy" some of this alliance gas for PGL.  What we are looking at is 
reducing your baseload sale and part of their DIQ and replacing it with 
alliance gas.  We'll talk about it later.

Barbara,

I met with some people from Alliance Pipeline yesterday to discuss
nominations and confirmations.  Attached is a piece of information that
might be of interest to the daily group.  Could you route to the rest of the
group?

Thanks.

Thanks for the picture.  I'm glad you guys like the gift.  Luke looks just 
like Rena, huh?

As far as Ricigs goes, I don't have his phone # or address.  I think Moller 
does though.
Let me know  if you need his #.  Take care and tell Rena and Luke we said hi.

We will be in town.  It would be great to see you and Marie.  Sorry for the 
delayed response,
I seem to check my emails around once every 2 weeks.  I hope you could make

Let me know.

Kev,

Don't know if this found you or not but I got your new EMail address sent back
to me.  We also just received the gift from you and Lisa.  Thanks a bunch.
Luke will definitely cuddle up in the warmth after his baths.  Say hello to
Lisa.  You know Rena will have the formal Thank You off in the mail soon.  
Hope
to see you guys soon.  By the way, do you have Bill Ricigliano's phone # by
chance.  Send it to me if you do.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  4/20  and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are two  worksheets labelled as follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.

Attached please find the nipsco changes for the 20th.  Please note that there 
is a change on the ANR leg from 200 @ ANR/Ft Wayne to 141 @ ANR/Ft Wayne and 
59 @ ANR/Michigan City.   This will balance your Pool B and make you take the 
withdrawal on Pool A.   Otherwise you would be injecting on Pool B and 
withdrawing on Pool A.  


Total Demand:    Nominated  Difference

Pool A  936   859   (77)     
Pool  B  141   141       0

Total  1,077   1,000   (77)

Also, please note that all changes for 4/21 thru 4/24 are due to be nominated 
on 4/20/00 since Nipsco is closed for the holiday on Friday so if you are 
increasing or decreasing volumes over the weekend I need to have those 
numbers no later than 9:30 tomorrow morning.


Thanks,


Cora

Responses:
1.  I'll let Kevin answer this one.  ANR and Michcon are Central Desk pipes.

2.  I would prefer to address all items on Exhibit 1.  If possible I would 
like to see the original Exhibit 1 volumes and updated Exhibit 1 volumes 
through March 2001.  However, I don't remember buying back any baseload gas 
on TCO for April.  I thought we priced everything at FOM IF and every day, we 
are buying back gas at GD - $.01.

3.  Are you doing a buy sell with Erron at the same price?  Does Duke bill 
CES directly for this?  

4.  See attached worksheets.

5.  I don't know all the information on the local production yet.  The 
pricing I'm currently using is the Exhibit 1 FOM deliverd pricing (pricing 
using ENA transport).  The attached April file has a Local Production tab.  
Molly Johnson is updating this information.  After she completes April, she 
will recreate Jan - Mar.

6.   Since the delivered pricing on TCO is the same, I'm not concerned about 
the individual citygate volumes.  For pricing purposes, I only care about 
total daily deliveries.   It would be a problem if you were trying to take 
additional gas from a non-constrained citygate to a constrained citygate and 
you don't have enough capacity.  This holds true for most other pipelines as 
well, Tenn Z6, CNG North Citygate, CNG South Citygate, ...  This would be a 
better question for Charlie to ask me when he is looking for something 
specific as it comes up.  The only thing I will not allow you to do is take 
gas from one pipeline to the other, Texas Gas Z4 to CGAS, and Colleen has 
discussed this with Melissa.

Subject: Questions


Chris--Below is a list of questions that we need to address fairly quickly.
Please look it over and let's talk.  The items are not prioritized in any way.

1-Enron's invoices show that for deliveries to Muncie (Indiana Gas) off ANR 
the
price index used is Michcon.citygate.GD.M.I.   The same is true for delivery
points into Michcon.   Is this correct, or are you actually using ANR ML-7 
plus
the Exhibit 1 increment applicable to Michcon?   Exhibit 1 specifies ANR ML-7
as the price index for Michcon.

2-CES has completely exited the following market areas/zones as of April 1:
TCO 6-11, TCO 6-12.   However, because Exhibit 1 contains projected volumes 
for
these two market areas in April 00, CES had to purchase from and resell to
Enron 90% of the April volumes contained in Exhibit 1.  Exhibit 1 contains
projected volumes for both market areas thru October 2000.   Are we required 
to
do a purchase/sell-back in each of these future months, or can we dispense 
with
this?  I refer you to Section 3.6 of the Gas Supply Assignment and Agency
Agreement (p. 11-12) as having some bearing on this issue.

3-The monthly volumes in Exhibit 1 off Iroquios into Central Hudson are
incorrect.  The 4,200 Dth is a monthly volume, not a Dth/day volume.  Since 
the
supply for this point is already arranged as a back-to-back with Duke Energy
and since Duke appears to be billing us directly for this gas, I do not intend
to do a simultaneous "buy/sell"  with Enron of the volumes in excess of the
(erroneous) Exhibit 1 volume.  If you disagree, let's discuss.

4-According to Exhibit 1, CES gets monthly capacity releases for TCO 4-21
(O&R),  TCO 7-3 (West Ohio), TGP Zone 6 (Boston Gas?), would you please 
provide
me with the Dth of capacity released to Enron as CES's agent on a monthly 
basis
for April at each of these points?   (I also need these numbers for January,
February, and March.)

5-How is the local production behind NYSEG, NFGD-PA, and CPA priced?

6-How will Enron invoice CES for daily swings on TCO in situations where gas
was merely being re-directed from one delivery point (where we were long for
that day) to another delivery point (where we were short)?


There will undoubtedly be other questions.  I will direct them to you as they
arise.

Thanks.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  4/18 and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'TCO Storage':  Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its (paper) storage
injection for the month.    Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet
some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the
"Daily Change' worksheet.    NOTE:  THis worksheet omitted pending resolution
of issues related to TCO storage.

The attached file is an updated version of the one that I sent a few minutes
ago of the same name.   The changes are minor and are as follows:

*In the Daily Chg worksheet, the intraday change on BGE of +303 is all on
Choice+DCQ.  The original had 40 dth of the increase on Choice +DCQ and the
remaining 263 on EU 164, which was not correct.  No changes were made to the
volumes in the Total Reqs. worksheet which were correct in the original
version.

Sorry for any inconvenience.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  4/12  and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'TCO Storage':  Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its (paper) storage
injection for the month.    Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet
some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the
"Daily Change' worksheet.    Note that this worksheet is omitted pending
resolution of issues related to TCO storage.

Nelson,
As you know, Grand Cheniere was under maintenance in October and we had to 
shut in Johson Bayou.   Francis wants us to reallocate (trespass gas) that 
they continued to flow onto ANR in the amout of  54,536mm to us  at an agreed 
upon price of $5.20.   ANR has agreed to do this next week.  Since you are 
out today Francis asked us to make sure you called him about this as well as 
another issue.

Attached is an updated version of the daily file that I sent earlier this
morning.  The only change is to the volumes for NIPSCO.  All other volumes
should be the same as those in the earlier version.  sorry for any confusion.


The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for 4/10/00 and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for 4/7  and
beyond.    There are three worksheets:  The one labelled 'Total Reqs' contains
the volumes that we need at each of the delivery points indicated.   The
schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at a
specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

The sheet labelled TCO stg shows daily swings on our paper TCO storage
injections.

Kelly,

I spoke with my friend and he mentioned that Michael was already talking to 2 
firms and he
didn't want to recommend a third at this time.  I told him that if anything 
changes, let me know.
It was worth a try anyway.  I'll talk to you soon.

That would be great.  Let me know so I could get tix to a ballgame if the 
Astros are in town that weekend.
I'm going to the game next Monday to see McGwire and the Cards.  Glad to hear 
everything's going well.

I got a call from Peremes on Saturday.  She heard I got engaged and was 
pissed I didn't tell her.  I think she's
smoking serious crack 'cause I told her when I talked to her about 6 mos. 
ago.  I guess she just chose to ignore
me as usual.

Talk to you soon.

P.S.  We just closed on a house this past Friday.  It's in need of some 
serious work.  Hopefully it'll be
habitable by the time you see it.

Subject: I'll keep taking punches until their will grows  tired.

In 1974 the S&P 500 dropped 27% AFTER the first  rate cut by the fed.? In 
1981 it dropped 15% AFTER the first rate cut by  the fed.? With a S&P 500 
still trading at twice it's growth rate, 20 vs  10, a NASDAQ still trading at 
70 times earings, and a bullish advisor sentiment  still at 55%, the backdrop 
for a sharp rally isn't very good.? In a slowing  earnings enviroment I 
believe investors should focus on two sectors.? The  first are companies like 
Tootsie Roll Industries that manage to grow earnings  like clockwork.? 
Secondly, telecom/tech companies that are trading at their  growth rate and 
there is some assurrance that their customers are in a position  to keep 
ordering and paying for products.? For Tootsie Roll Industries it  is easy 
since the end user is the consumer and this products' consumption is  fairly 
recession proof.?? Efficient Networks' customers are SBC  Communications and 
others who then install their products to offer their  customer price savings 
that justify their capital investment. As long as SBC's  is financially 
strong and their ROI warrants the investment, the Efficient's of  the world 
appear to be interesting ideas.?  


? There will be layoffs not just in the DOT com world, probably everybody  at 
AMAZON, but also certain industries like the Financials and Auto's.?  This 
should remove once and for all any last Greenspan' fears of a wage led  
inflationary revival.? His comments yesterday were an admittance that this  
economy is softer than 14 feet of fresh powder in Montana.? Housing prices  
and financial assets were simply too inflated in general.? That doesn't  mean 
there aren't some good real estate markets and it doesn't mean there aren't  
any fair priced companies.

Hi Kev,

I sent this e-mail to your original Enron address and got an automated
response saying that it had changed.  Here it is again just in case you
didn't get it.  Drop me a line when you can.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for   4/3
(Intraday)     and 4/4  .    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled with
today's date contains the volumes that we need at each of the delivery points
indicated.   The schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas
is needed at a specific point.   The AGL volumes in this spreadsheet are not
current and should be ignored.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

Friends,

Siddhartha, Nidhesh, and I are moving back home to Calcutta, India in April, 
2000.

Attached are our contact details.  I would have loved to contact each one of 
you directly but this has happened in a hurry and we have to pack, wrap up 
and leave Houston by April 20.  So please call to catch up and maybe plan a 
visit to Calcutta!

My work email and voicemail will remain active as I will be on a leave of 
absence from Azurix.  I will check them periodically.  Today is my last day 
at work. 

I hope that you will make to the happy hour that Gaby is planning next week. 
I would love to see you.

Regards,

-sheetal

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  3/29  and 3/30
.    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled with today's date contains 
the
volumes that we need at each of the delivery points indicated.   The 
schedulers
will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at a specific
point.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

In what appears to be a rather unoriginal move these days, I've resigned from 
Mother Enron in favor of an early stage .com opportunity.  My last day will 
be this Friday, March 31st.

I'm not a fan of long goodbyes, so let me just say 'thank you' to each of 
you, for the part you played in making my two and a half years at Enron both 
memorable and rewarding.  My new employer (HomeWrite.com) is Houston-based, 
so with the glaring exception of Iaia, I hope to see each of you in the not 
so distant future. 

All my best,

Scott

The attached file is an update to the file of the same name that I sent 
earlier
this morning.   The only change is a reduction in daily Dth off Transco Z5 
into
Piedmont from 950/day to 50/day for 3/29 thru the end of March.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for
and          .    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled with today's 
date
contains the volumes that we need at each of the delivery points indicated.
The schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at 
a
specific point.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

Subject: April '00 FOM numbers for CES


Chris--Attached is the spreadsheet that we spoke of earlier today.  I have 
made
the correction to TCO Op 2, Mkt Area 20 into NYSEG (i.e. +854 dth/day).   I
will make the necessary changes to the AGL volumes over the next few minutes.
As we discussed, we'll need to resolve the question about Central Hudson off
Iroquois (we may not need any volumes there since Duke is the supplier), and 
as
I said, we'll be discussing our needs into southern Connecticut on a firm 
basis
with other suppliers.   I am also attaching the spreadsheet with the storage
injections for assigned storage.   I believe that we need to negotiate the
price for all of the  April storage injections.

Chris--The attached file contains the daily changes for 3/27 and 3/28 in the
volumes of gas that we need by market area.  The daily changes are relative to
what we requested on a First-of-the month basis, which values appear in Col.
DD.   You can just open this file and print it out to see the magnitude of the
changes by market area or zone.  We'll be calling regarding pricing.

Chris and Kevin--The attached file contains our latest daily volume
requirements for 3/20 and the rest of March.   One caveat:  I have included
here the additional 150 dth/day into Piedmont off Transco for 3/21-3/31.
However, we are still waiting on a price quote from Chris for that volume.  If
we end up getting that gas elsewhere, I will send you a revised spreadsheet 
w/o
the additional 150dth/day into Piedmont.

Having seen the trouble with the votes in Florida, I think this new more
technical ballot will help in the next election or if a revote is ordered.

Kevin,

How's things?  Been a while since we talked.  Hope your jobs are going well
and your wedding plans are proceeding smoothly.

Did you get my e-mail about running into Mary Eyre in the gym in San Mateo?
Spooky.  I've seen her a couple more times but I haven't spoken to her; I
get in the "properly pumped" zone.  Turns out there are a lot of classmates
on the peninsula - David Park, Frank Knifsend, Mary, and James Regan come to
mind immediately.

No real news here.  We haven't broken anything in the house in a while, so
either we're getting luckier or we're due.  Both jobs are very busy right
now so the weekends are for recuperating.  This weekend, of course, will be
for watching basketball.

Hi to Lisa - let us know how you're doing.

Regards,

Tim Sarhatt
Sr. Treasury Analyst

Steve--The attached file contains estimates for the upcoming 12-month period 
of
our monthly flowing volume requirements for the NIPSCO Choice program,
including estimated peak-day requirements (part of which come out of
storage).   I am referring to the values in Cols. L,M, and N in the attached.
Can you please give us a price quote for getting these volumes to the NIPSCO
citygate?

Please call me if you have questions.

Thanks.

Kevin,

Great to hear from you!  I was beginning to think you had dropped off the
face of the earth.

I am getting on the boat in about 4 hours - midnight.  Actually, it's not
too bad that way as I go right to sleep when I get on.  I fly at night on
Saturday so I can sleep in.  Fortunately, I will only be on the boat for 18
days as we are conducting the exercise in Okinawa vice another country.
Hopefully, the situation in Taiwan won't deteoriate between now and when I
get off.

Great news about the house!  Send us some digital photos if you have them.
I think it is better to buy a house that needs some work as you are able to
get more home for the cash.  Also, it is easier to turn a profit if you
sell.  Not to mention having some projects in work is always a good hobby.

Marie and I came really close to making an offer on a beach house in Navarre
beach.  Fortunately, reason got the best of us and we are waiting until we
get back before we make such a monumental decision.  There are just too many
factors involved to make the decision from some digital photos.  So, are you
planning on staying in Houston for a while?

A smaller wedding sounds like a good plan.  To me, having a few close
friends present is always better than a bunch of strap hangers.  However,
most chicks would probably disagree.  Marie seems to have had no regrets
with our ultra small wedding.  Just let me know what you need me to do to
help pull it off.

If all goes well, we will start heading home in mid-June and settle in
around early August.  I will also be home for Erin's wedding in May.  We
will also be doing some house hunting in Pensacola at that time.  We will be
in the states from the 20th of May through the 9th of June.  Let me know if
you are available on the first or last weekend and we will stop in Houston
on the way in or out for a day or two.  The tickets we buy allow us four
stops anywhere in the US.

The only wild card in all of this is Test Pilot School.  I applied to the
board that meets in May.  If I get selected, I would go to Maryland instead
of Florida and it wouldn't be until mid-November.  If that happens, and I
actually hope it doesn't, we would either stay here for a few more months or
go to Md. early.  Either way, I will be at your wedding.

Glad to hear from you,

Frank

My address on the boat will be

conwayfp@belleau-wood.usmc.mil

Chump,

Long time no hear.  Sorry it's taken me so long to touch base with you.  
Between work, the wedding,
and the fact that we just purchased a house (pending inspections) I've been 
pretty stressed.
As far as the wedding goes Lisa and I have decided to scale down 
considerably.  We're only going
to have immediately family and the folks in the wedding party.  For me that 
includes you of course, Moller,
Kampy and Peremes (even though she won't be in the wedding).  Don't tell her 
though, she's the only
one I haven't mentioned anything to.  I'll make sure you and Moller get to 
share a room.  I feel kinda bad
about not inviting Lowery since I was in his wedding, but I don't feel like 
dealing with Kim.  She's really 
annoyed me the last few times I've seen her.

We still plan on having it at the B&B in Long Beach Island.  We'll have a 
catered dinner for about 45 folks.
It should be more manageable and cheaper this way.

Do you have the exact date when you'll move back to the states?  I'm psyched 
you'll be a lot closer.  You
could swing over to Houston and check out the new house.  By that time we 
should have it in decent shape.
We bought the ugliest, most beat-up house on the block.  It definitely needs 
a lot of work.  We'll be busy for
the next year working on it.  I think when it's done,  it'll look pretty cool.

Anyway,  send me an email and let me know how everything's going and when 
you'll be back.  Take care and
tell Marie we said hi.

Kevin

Attached please find a copy of volumes delivered to  Columbia Energy Services 
for March 1 thru March 9, 2000.  I downloaded this directly from Michcon's 
system  and the actual volumes Columbia received at each meter point is in 
the ADJ NOM VOLUME column.  It is broken out in what was delivered in dth and 
what was delivered in mcf.    I have also added a column to show the 
difference between what was delivered in dth vs mcf.   

We had numerous problems with nominations on Michcon's system for the dates 
of 3/2 thru 3/7, however Tom Butzon with Michcon worked very hard to make 
sure that all of our markets were kept whole.   After reviewing deliveries to 
CES per Michcon's system this is the breakout per day:

   Per CES Request  Per Michcon  Difference
3/1/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/2/00   11,417    11,240   (177)
3/3/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/4/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/5/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/6/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/7/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/8/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/9/00   11,450    11,450   0


I spoke with Tom this afternoon regarding the cut on 3/2/00 and he cannot go 
back and reallocate that point.    Regarding the increase for 3/8/00 it is 
imperative that Donna calls us to let us know that she sent an email due to 
the fact that we do not always have time to check email in time to get the 
gas put in the position for the next day.  Also in the event that someone is 
out and that person cannot check their email, a simple telephone call to the 
scheduler would help tremendously.  

Reqarding Doug's letter dated 3/7/00 regarding insufficient volumes at 
acceptable points for the Michcon Select Program, it is my understanding that 
a volume of 7,300 mcf is the requirement CES has to the Select Program.  On 
the attached spreadsheet I have broken out the points Enron delivered gas to 
CES on the acceptable points and we have met those requirements every day 
with the exception of 3/8 and 3/9 where Enron shorted CES volumes at required 
Map #'s by 272 mcf.  This was due to late changes we received by our 
suppliers.   If CES did incur penalties on 3/1 thru 3/7 then CES needs to 
look at how they are allocating each point since certain points are to be 
delivered to the Select Program first.   When CES receives all their points 
for the day they should first allocate the SELECT points to their SELECT 
customers, the remaining points  can then be divided up between their other 
non specific customers.   I apologize for the confusion but I believe we have 
made a valiant effort to keep CES whole at the proper points as best we 
could.  



Should you have any questions, please call me at 713-853-9138.

Congrats Murli,

Sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you.  I'm glad you accepted a job 
at Enron.
I know you'll enjoy it.  As far as ECI goes, what group is this?  Is this the 
Communications
group?  I would not recommend EES however.  I think you're experience would 
be better
at ECT (now ENA) or Enron Communications.   Give me a call at 713-853-6320 
(W) and
we can talk.  Also I'm still in an apt so I don't know any real estate 
brokers to refer you to.

Talk to you soon.

Dave,

It was great getting a chance to finanlly meet the other night.  Hope you 
enjoyed dinner.

Since then, I've been thinking abt some of our conversation re: the PBR.  I 
have a quick
question - why wouldn't you under withdraw in Feb and over withdraw in Mar if 
Mar is currently
higher than Feb.  You could lock this in by buying Mar forward.  Also,  what 
happens if you
withdraw in Mar and the Summer peaks higher than what you withdrew at?  How 
is this accounted
for?

I'll talk to you after you get back from Houston.

than Harvards.

Congratulations!!

I couldn't be happier for you two.  How's Rena feeling - probably relieved, 
huh?
Thanks for the call with the news.  We were out for the day, that's why 
didn't get back
to you.  I'll try you today.

Kevin

P.S.  Great Name

You gotta get more current jokes.  That one's been floating around for quite 
some
time now.  How's everything in SF?  Have you moved into your new office?

Thanks for the email.  Sorry it took so long to get back to you - I actually 
am just catching up

Great to hear from you as always.  It'll be great to have you 
back in the states.  By the way, I attached a copy of the boys.
I hope it comes across OK.

Talk to you soon.

Great to hear from you.  Things have been going well in Houston.  Lisa is 
working for Johnson Controls.
It must be a long time since we've talked b/c she's been with Johnson for 
about 5 months.  I love my
new job - I'm trading gas up in the Midwest market area - Illinois and 
Michigan.  Things have been 
incredibly busy.

The wedding plans have changed considerably.  As I'm sure you can relate to, 
the stress of planning 
combined with the input of so many others have made us decide to have a 
wedding with only our folks 
there and not even have a reception.   We figured we could put the money 
toward a house and save
a lot of anger, frustration and stress.

How's the job, new house, and Terri doing?  Have you been to many Bears 
games?  The Scarlet Knights
have been so inconsistent this year.  I think a lot is due to their youth.

Let's talk soon.

Kevin

Unfortunately, it doesn't look like I'll be able to interview at UCLA on the 
11th.
Keep me in mind for next time though.

If I understand you correctly, it may depend to an extent on season basis 
differentials as well.
Why don't you give me a call so I could better understand what you're trying 
to do.

T.J.,

I need your LA address.  I'm sure I have it some place but I can't find it.
How's everything going?  How's Rena?  Are you heading home for the 
holidays or staying in LA?

Also,  if you have Lowery's address and phone # could you forward it.

Thanks,

Kevin

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Mark Frevert and Mark Haedicke

Of course your Dad would be invited to anything we do, but if you'd rather 
spend the
time alone with him that weekend we could always make it another weekend.  
The only
problem with the 12th is that we'll be consumed with the move the entire 
weekend.  Let
me know what works for you.  We're flexible after the 12th.

Matt or Frank,

Please provide a sigma factor for the following product type requested by 
Kevin Ruscitti:

US Gas Phy Fwd Secondary Firm

A US gas transaction with Enron North America Corp., under which Seller shall 
sell and Buyer shall purchase a quantity of natural gas equal to the Daily 
Contract Quantity at the Contract Price on a Secondary Firm basis.  The 
Contract Price shall be as submitted by Counterparty via the Website.  The 
Period of Delivery shall be from the Effective Date through the Termination 
Date.
The term of the Transaction shall be from the Effective Date to the 
Termination Date. The Effective Date is 01 May 2001. The Termination Date is 
31 May 2001.
The Transaction is for delivery at an ANR Pipeline Company ML7 interconnect.  
The Purchaser will determine at what ML7 interconnect to take delivery.  The 
volumes Delivered by the Seller are subject to reductions due to operational 
constraints on the ANR Pipeline system. In the event that scheduled volumes 
are reduced due to pipeline operational constraints, Buyer will designate an 
alternate ML7 delivery location until an unconstrained point is designated.  
In the event that the Buyer cannot take receipt at an alternative ML7 point, 
the Buyer must arrange for the gas to be delivered off-system, stored or 
parked at the Buyer's expense. These reductions due to Pipeline System 
constraints are not considered a failure to perform by the Purchaser.
The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the 
Contractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be millions of 
British thermal units and the quantity shown shall be in millions of BTUs per 
day.




Thanks,

CW

Kevin,

Siobhan let me know that she reached you last week.  Thanks for taking the
time to forward my credentials within Enron to their Wind operation.  I have
a resume and a general cover letter zipped to this email.

Just to let you know in case you speak with someone at Enron Wind, I sent a
"cold" resume about two weeks back for an opening in project sales/marketing
(Job codes 111363/111364).  They have many interesting projects on the table
and I am eager to talk with their recruiter about global openings.

Let me know if there is anything I must do to follow up or provide additional
information.  Thanks again for your help.

David

Kevin Ruscitti has requested a secondary firm ANR ML7 phy gas product for 
EOL.  I have located some language that you and Dale worked on back in May of 
2000.  Please let me know if this language will be OK for our needs.  Also, 
will the current GTC for Phy gas need to be revised in any way?

Let me know if you're looking to sell some more, because I could do better 
than my

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

We'll just be doing some house shopping.  I think we're going to postpone the 
upgrade to
the existing house and look to buy a new house.  This would eliminate the 
need to move
out for 6 months.  I'm dying to live in a house that is complete.  Anyway, 
besides this we
don't seem to have much going on.  I'll just need to go into work for a few 
hours on Sunday.

Let me know what you want to do.

You're correct, Enron doesn't get too involved in these conventions.  I don't 
know 
why.  It seems that some of the desks have some functions but mine never 
does.   My desk
seems to be pretty apathetic (probably not a good thing).  I think we've 
relied, more than
any of our other desks, on the financial and e-commerce sides of the 
business.  Probably
not a great thing.  Anyway, lets get together for a cocktail or dinner 
sometime within the 
next month.  Did you guys move to the Galleria location yet.  Let me know - 
we'll go get 
a big steak at Morton's or Ruths' Chris.  I assume a country boy like you is 
into some
good red meat.

you obviously know the energy market better than most.  My guy at goldman,
Jonathan Raleigh, has been on calpine for 4 years and has killed it, so i'm
just following his lead. as for the futile leadership in ca, i agree.
wouldn't it be nice for you, me , tj, and sweets to run a company or a
state. j

Stamos, 

Glad everyone had a good time at Sweets'.  I hope he had a blast.

In terms of your email reply,
you can have Calpine.  How are they going to make money long term if price 
caps are instituted?  This obviously would be the stupidest policy.  In 
addition
their exposure to the CA crisis must be pretty significant - when and how are 
they
going to get paid?  I wouldn't want to bank on the energy market in the most 
regulated state in the country.  Plus, if the state backs energy purchases, 
it's 
going to get to the point where who wants to own CA credit??  PG&E and Edison
International are doomed, as they should be.  The state of CA is going to go
down the tubes unless they find some good leadership.  Unfortunately, noone
out there seems to have the least clue on how to solve the problem.  The 
politicians
are a complete joke.  It is incredibly disheartening to witness the absolute 
stupidity
of the CA politicians in addressing this issue.  They seem to be much more 
focused 
on finger pointing than coming up with a viable solution.  I honestly think 
they are incable
of solving the problem.

good points and yes the Dow just needs one more week like this to trade
under 9000 so 8000 is not a stretch.   Markets typically predict a recession
long before it arrives.  In the second q of this year you will see some sort
of headline that says Recession hits US.  I would buy that day.  As for
california, the worlds 6th largest economy,  energy is obviously your space
but I think that the calpines, capstones, and others are options such as the
contract they received last month.  Hope all is well.  Sweets party was fun.
It was only missing you and TJ. j

the election




Looks like Maury and I will be moving back to Texas soon, based on the
following proposal....

Solution to the Election:

#1:  Al Gore becomes President of the United States (all 49
states).

#2:  George W. Bush becomes the President of The Republic of Texas.

Gore shouldn't mind as he said we were the worst state in the union
during the campaign.

So what does Texas have to survive as a Republic?:

NASA in Houston, Texas (we will control the space industry).

We refine over 85% of the gasoline in the United States (that is why
Houston has problems with the air quality).

Defense Industry (we have over 65% of it).  The term "Don't mess
with Texas," will take on new meaning.

Oil - we can supply all the oil the Republic of Texas will need for
the next 300 years.

Natural Gas-Again we have all we need (too bad about those northern
states). Al Gore will figure a way to keep Tipper and you warm....

Computer Industry-we currently lead the nation in producing computer
chips.
A small place named Texas Industries, Dell Computer, EDS, etc., etc.

Health Centers-We have the largest research centers for Cancer
research, the best burn centers, and other large health planning centers.


We have enough colleges to keep us going:  UT, Texas A&M, Rice,
University of Houston, SMU, Baylor, UNT, Texas Women's University, etc.

We have a ready supply of workers (just open the border when we need
some more) and our friends across the border will pour in by the
thousands.

We have control of the paper industry, plastics, insurance, etc.

This just names a few of the items that will keep the Republic of
Texas afloat.

Now to the rest of the United States under President Gore:

Since you won't have the refineries to get gas for your cars, only
President Gore will be able to drive around in his SUV which gets him
about 9  miles per gallon.  The rest of the United States will have to
walk or ride bikes.

You won't have any TV as the space center in Houston will cut off
your communications.

You won't have any natural gas to heat your homes but since Al's
promised global warming, I'm sure you won't get cold!

You won't need our computer chips since you won't have electricity
to power the computers.

So don't worry about us down here in Texas.  We will be OK.

David J. Robinson, D. Min.
President
Houston Graduate School of Theology

Stamos,

I don't think many buying opportunities out there.   The economy is going to 
get 
crushed this year.  There's only one place to put one's money now, and that 
is in cash.
The manufacturing sector is in dire straits and you will continue to see an 
increase in
plant shutdowns and company layoffs.  The Fed could continue to lower rates 
but there'll
be little capital investment if consumer spending dries up.  I feel we've 
just seen the beginning.  
I think the Dow will be trading under 8000 by the end of April.

Psychologically, the California crisis will add to consumer fear.  The crisis 
is not a short term
problem.  As a result, barring any Federal bailout, you could kiss that 
state's economy goodbye.
Let me ask you a question; if you were paying (1) the highest real estate 
prices in the country, and 
(2) the highest energy prices for the least reliable power, in (3) the midst 
of a hi-tech meltdown, what would
keep you or your company from closing shop and moving to a different state??  
If you own any
CA real estate, sell.  The only way to solve the CA energy crisis is to 
reduce demand or increase supply.
Since CA doesn't want any power plants in its backyard, the supply issue 
likely won't be solved anytime
soon.  So, how do impact demand??  You have to price energy(power/gas) so 
high that
the discretionary user (household, manufacturer, commercial store) conserves 
by closing its plant, cutting
back on the thermastat or running the commercial operation during off-peak 
hours.  California will see
this reduction in demand over time.  If the blackouts subside it's because so 
many businesses have
closed their doors for good or moved to another state.  Without this, the 
blackouts will get much worse.
If the state tries to get into the business of buying and selling electricity 
and gas, I would bet it will go
bankrupt within 2-3 yrs.  Could you imagine the impact on the national 
economy from the bankruptcy 
of the U.S.'s most prosperous state.  Obviously this is only my opinion, but 
I would keep my eyes on
the energy markets - that's where the key to the turnaround lies.  Take Care 
and thanks for the email.

That state will never be the same.  My prediction is that the state will be
bankrupt within the next 2 years unless the Federal Gov't bails it out.  I 
hope
Lowery has held off on buying his house.

Talk to you this weekend.  I blew off the Montana trip so I'll be home.

Great to hear from you.  Looking forward to meeting in Houston for a baseball 
game.
Conway will be in Corpis soon so we should be able to do a weekend.  We 
should start
construction on the house in May - what an incredibly long process it is.  I 
definitely would
not do it if I had to do it over again.  One redeeming factor is that we 
bought on a good 
block.  We definitely have the ugliest house on the block.  We should get a 
pop in real
estate also when all the California companies start migrating to Texas.  

Joking aside, unless you guys have incredibly mild weather this summer 
combined with
a lot of rainfall, you're summer will suck.  There is no doubt that the CA 
economy is going
to suffer a great recession.  You have a shortage of supply so the only way 
to ease the
problem is to reduce demand.  This usually occurs when prices reach levels 
where the price
sensitive buyers cut back.  However, with your boy Grey Davis pushing for  
price caps, this won't
happen.   The next way for demand to be trimmed is for companies to leave, so 
this will probably
need to happen to an extent for the problem to ease.  The other factor, of 
course, is that you
could have an increase in supply - new power plants.  But being that the amt. 
of time it takes to 
develop and build a power plant in CA is about 3 times as long as in most 
other states combined
with the fact that CA hasn't had a new power plant in the last 10 years, an 
increase in supply
doesn't seem likely in the short term.  Again, this is only my opinion, so 
you could take it with
a grain of salt.  

Talk to you soon.

Kevin

BL,

Have you experienced any blackouts yet?  I think you'll see a lot this summer.
What does everyone think about the situation?  Do they think it's a threat or 
not?  I think
the state is in for a horrific summer - I hope it doesn't turn out that way, 
but it'll be incredibly
difficult to avoid.

Hope everything's going well with work and with the family.  When's the next 
time you'll
be in Dallas?  Let me know.

Wow, what a gracious thank you.  I'm speechless.

Hope everything's been going well lately.  I'll talk to you soon.  By the way,
are you going to any events during Gas Fair?

Kev-it certainly sounds like you have alot on your hands with the house, but
i'm sure it will all work out.  Maybe you can call rabbit to come and do some
renovation work.  after all, he did spend his entire sophomore year building
the brothers bar!!  Or maybe give marro a call-he was the house manager and
pretty good with his hands.  Or better yet, give morgante a ring.  he won't
show up, but he'll take your wife out for a date.  By the way,
congratulations on getting married!!  Next time you come to NJ I'll give you
your present (it's on ice, don't worry)
    Yes I am still dating beth.  It's a little tough with the distance (as
i'm sure you can understand), but we do the best we can and when we see each
other it's always great.  We actually spent new year's down in mexico.
Matter of fact i picked up the rest of my pictures the other day and quickly
proceeded to become depressed at the fact that i am here and not there.
Needless to say we had a great time.  You know, we are figuring on taking a
trip sometime in the spring, maybe vegas.  it would be unbelievable if you
and lisa could meet us.  Or maybe we can even visit you guys.  let me know.
    I saw sweets new office recently.  He and i had lunch.  I'll tell you
something, he is such a great guy.  everytime i call him for anything, no
matter how long it's been since i've talked to him, he always acts like i
just spoke with him.  I have to fax you the letter he sent to me last year.
It was fucking hilarious.  Anyway, the office is great and i met one of his
new partners.  i'm sure they will do excellent there.
    I hope work is going well.  I'm keeping my eye on enron.  they are always
in the NY Times with some sort of inventive stuff that they're doing.  It
looks like a pretty cool company.  I also have a mutual fund that invests
heavily in the company.
    My work has been extremely hectic, but things couldn't be better.  My
partner pete and i merged our office with another guy on January 1 and now we
are a 3 partner firm.  We bought a building in Hawthorne and we close on
April 1.  I'm looking forward to getting into the building soon.  We have to
wait though for some renovations to be done.  But it should be pretty
exciting.  It's  a victorian house and it's a real nice setup.
    The only other person i have seen recently is coun.  He and Chris met
Beth and i for lunch a couple of weeks ago at the short hills mall.
Oh-before i forget, my number at work is (973) 569-0888.  Give me a call
soon, and give me your work number as well.
    Oh one last thing, give me moller's e-mail address if you have it.  And
something else, let me know next time you guys are road tripping to louisiana
or wherever else.  i am definitely in.
    Well take care, definitely stay in touch and by all means give the former
Ms. taggart my best.  It was great hearing from you.

Hi all,

I am on the move again.  In case anyone has travel plans to the NE or TX,
I'll will be in either NJ or DC from the 4th-24th of March and in Corpus
Christi from the 24th of March through early May.  I'll settle in at Pax
River (SE MD) sometime in late May.  This email account should remain active
throughout or you can reach me at conway77@hotmail.com or on my cell at
850.939.8989.

Hope all is well,

Frank

Jen,

Great to hear from you.  Early congrats on your graduation.  Everything has 
been
going well down in the Lone Star State.  I got married in September down the 
Jersey
shore and everything has been going well.  We bought a house back in May.  It 
needs
an incredible amount of work.  We own the ugliest house on the block, by far.

How are things in Indiana?  Are you and Paul still together?  How is he 
doing?  When
is the last time you were back in Jersey?  We went back over Christmas but 
only for
a couple days.  I think next year we'll go back during New Year's instead of 
Christmas.
If you ever get near Texas or pass through Houston, please give us a call.  
You both
are always welcome to stay at our house.  My phone # is (713) 880-4157.  My 
work
# is (713) 853-6320.  Hope to hear from you soon.

Kevin

Hey Kev,

Good to hear from you.  Hope all is well.  Well we out here in the Golden 
State
could certainly use some help from you and the boys at 
Enron...................
Gray Davis is a little mouse!  That about describes most peoples opininion of
him.  The power and natural gas situation out here is a mess!  The gas 
situation
is much worse for us at this point here in Long Beach.  We haven't seen any
power outages or any significant increase in our bill either.  The gas front 
is
an entirely different matter!  I just paid a $300 bill for the month of Dec.  
I
paid $100 for the same month in 1999.  The usage (therms) was the
same............ figure that one out?!?!  At that level I might as well be
paying for heating oil in Maine.  Most people I talk to have scene their gas
bill go up 2 or 3 fold.

Anyway, things could be a whole lot worse I guess.  Luke just had his 1st
birthday party this past weekend.  It was quite the scene.  I think his next
party will be when he is 18.  Say hello to Lisa for us.

TJ

Kevin,
We're doing very well in Seoul.  It's been nearly a year since I first 
arrived, time flies.  We've had a frigid winter and it's just starting to 
thaw out now.  Work has been good, very challenging.  I'll be in Houston 
during the week of Feb 20th on business.  Why don't we plan to get together 
then.  I'll follow up.

Duude,
What's happening? Finally getting around to getting
you my new email and tele #. I left Pru back in
mid-December and have been running non-stop with the
new job. It is a world of difference going from Corp
America to a start-up, but its been fun.

Been doing some traveling and spending a lot of time
trying to get new customers and servicing the ones we
sign up.

So how was N.O.? I'm sure that the three of you didn't
do any drinking or got into any trouble.

Tell the lovely Mrs. Ruscitti that we say hello. Don't
forget, let me know the next time you are in Jersey
and if you have time we should hook up.

I had bookmarked Mr. Conway's email on my computer at
Pru and forgot to take it with me, can you send it to
me. Thanks and talk to you soon,

The following article appeared in today's Chronicle.

Enron rating setup irks many workers 
By L.M. SIXEL 

TONGUES ARE WAGGING at Enron Corp., and it's not because of the bonuses 
they're expecting next month. 

Employees are irate about a new performance-review ranking system that pits 
them against each other. 

Under the system, nicknamed "rank and yank," employees will be put in one of 
five categories: 5 percent will be identified as "superior," 30 percent will 
be labeled "excellent," 30 percent will be called "strong," 20 percent will 
be labeled "satisfactory" and 15 percent will be called "needs improvement" 
or "issues." 

An insider said "needs improvement" means "you have one leg hanging out the 
window." And "issues" is Enron lingo for "you're gone." 

The rankings, whose names reportedly took Enron officials hours to come up 
with, are not based just on performance. 

Instead, they compare employee against employee. 

"It is possible, therefore, for someone to perform at the same or higher 
level compared to prior periods, yet receive a lower rating for the current 
period if other employees' performance raised the bar," according to a memo 
from Chief of Staff Steven Kean and Executive Vice President Cindy Olson that 
was distributed this month. 

While employees are competing against each other for ratings, they're also 
expected to be team players, according to the memo. 


`Horse-trading' of rank denied
The problem, according to someone familiar with the new system, is the 
horse-trading that goes on when the rankings are divided up. 

Managers trade rankings like baseball cards, explained the insider, offering 
to downgrade one employee if they can get a better rating for another 
employee. 

An employee's ranking is more a function of the negotiating skills of the 
manager he is working for, the insider said. 

Olson, who's over human resources and community relations, said no 
horsetrading is going on. The rankings, due out this week, aren't set in 
stone, she said. Only 9 percent of employees were rated in the bottom 
category while 6 to 7 percent were labeled superior, she said. 

But Olson said she can see how employees might be worried about the prospect 
of bargaining. 

She speculated that one reason employees might worry is because it's a new 
system for about 60 percent of Enron's employees. In years past, only the 
wholesale energy services group was ranked this way. 

Some human resource managers expressed surprise that Enron, which is known 
for hiring superstars, apparently feels that it must get rid of so many 
employees -- or at least put them on notice that they're not doing well. 

It doesn't say much about the confidence of your recruiting system if you're 
getting rid of 10 to 15 percent of your work force each year, said a human 
resource manager in Houston who asked to remain anonymous. 


Some may not fit in
Some people, as smart and talented as they are, just don't fit into Enron's 
culture, Olson said. It's a company that doesn't tell people what to do; you 
have to know what adds value, she said. Some folks just have a hard time in 
that environment. 

After thinking about it for a moment, Olson added that maybe Enron's 
recruiters aren't doing a good enough job weeding out the people who wouldn't 
do well in an entrepreneurial environment. 

Forced ranking systems were popular several years ago. But they fell out of 
favor, in part because they were seen as damaging employee motivation. 

Several years ago, Houston Lighting & Power put in a forced ranking system, 
dividing all employees into four groups, with "1" the top group and "4" the 
lowest. Employees were so angry with the system that some work crews had 
T-shirts printed: "Don't ask me -- I'm a 3." 

Olson said she doesn't see a problem with motivation. People like to know how 
they stand and will work hard to reach the top category, she said. 

But many of the employees -- at least the ones who rate above satisfactory -- 
won't know how they're rated. Managers don't have to reveal the ratings. 

And as for figuring out what it takes to be superior? You've got to reinvent 
your job, add new business lines or create something totally new. 

"Employees understand that when it's explained to them," Olson said.

Correction,  I don't think thinks will blow over this summer, I think things 
could blow
up and actually be a lot worse than they are now.  In terms of longer term, I 
think
a lot depends on how the state tries to resolve the problem.  It will be 
interesting to
see.  I feel that the summer will be very interesting, especially if 
California gets the
kind of heat they had last summer.  Stay in touch.

The house thing is a tough call.  It's hard to say.   If you're not in any 
hurry to buy, the summer should give
you a good indication of continuing energy problems.  I personally think that 
the problem will come and go 
for a while, but a lot depends on how California's legislature deals with the 
situation.  I have no idea what 
they'll end up doing - they've acted pretty poorly already.

What's your time frame on a house?  If you're only concern is that prices are 
at their highest level in the last 
decade, I wouldn't worry too much about that.  It's impossible to time the 
market -  who would've thought 
San Francisco's housing prices would be at these current levels.   There are 
also a lot of intangibles associated 
with home ownership as your aware of.   

I would be concerned about the energy situation, so just try to keep abreast 
of it.  Also, you could call me if you
have any questions.  I'll try to help the best I can.  Take care and tell Kim 
and Kendall I said hi.

Subject: Everythings Big in Texas?


Chump!
This energy crisis is making me question  my timing on buying a house.  I'm
thinking if the economy tanks the housing prices will dip a little.  They
just crack the highs of 1989 this last two years.  Any opinions?

I start my Texas travel in February.  I'll be in Dallas for the first full
week and back in March in Dallas again.  Starting the end of March I'll be
there almost every week for about 6 months.  You'll be seeing more of me than
you want.  When we get closer to March I'll give you a buzz to set up some
dates.
Sorry about the Kendall picture, I'll try again.

Take care, B

Brett,

I thought I had your home phone #, but I only have your work #.  As a result,
I didn't call you this weekend.  Send me your home # so I can give you a ring.

By the way, Happy 35th birthday.  I hope you had a good one.

Mr. B. Lowery,

First of all, you sent me a picture with the head cut off.  I couldn't even 
see Kendall.
I don't know if something happened with the translation of the file, but try 
to send
it again if you can.  

In regards to California's energy crisis, I think that California is screwed 
- big time.
I think it has the potential to cripple the state's economy.  If, like you 
said, noone 
really talks about it much in SoCal, I would bet that will change soon.  It 
has the potential
to affect every person in the state.  Not only will consumers end up bailing 
out the
utilities - SoCal Edison, San Diego, Gas and Electric, PG&E - but it will 
likely prevent
many new companies from setting up shop in California.  After all, who would 
want
to put millions of dollars in an operation that will be subject to power 
interruptions 
while paying the highest utility bills in the country.  I think that the only 
way California
will come out of this OK, is if it has the least energy intensive weather for 
the foreseeable
future.  I don't think this is a problem that will be resolved within the 
next couple years.
But remember, that is just my meaningless opinion.

When do you start coming to Texas.  Let me know so we can try to hook up.  
I'll talk to
you soon.

Bri,

What's the deal with this Gray Davis guy?  What's your opinion on him?
He's
pretty much out to lunch on this whole energy crisis thing.  I was
wondering how
the citizens of California viewed him.

Hope everything is going well with Kim, Kendall and yourself.  Talk to you
soon.
Send an updated picture if you have one.

With the extension of the PRC to all organizations, questions have arisen=
=20
about the results of this process. This memo provides some details about th=
e=20
PRC process.

First some context:  The key to Enron=01,s success is the increasing qualit=
y and=20
dedication of our talent.  As we continue to attract and retain the very be=
st=20
people, we all have continued to raise the performance bar throughout the=
=20
organization.  At the core of our system are the following principles:

? Hire the best people.
? Provide challenging opportunities.
? Pay well =01( and pay for performance (with bonuses based on merit, not=
=20
entitlement).
? Evaluate performance through a rigorous review process.
? Provide clear feedback and direction to employees.

The PRC is a critical component of our performance management system.  The=
=20
PRC is built on this foundation:

? 360 degree performance feedback.
? Review by a broad group, not just the supervisor.
? A relative ranking of performance across Enron to determine promotions an=
d=20
to allocate bonus money.


In addition to understanding this broad philosophy, we all need to understa=
nd=20
the following details:

? Relative ranking.  Enron uses the descriptors =01&superior=018, =01&excel=
lent=018,=20
=01&strong=018, "satisfactory", =01&needs improvement=018, and =01&issues=
=018 to group all=20
employees.  This year, =01&relative to his/her peers=018 precedes each of t=
hese=20
descriptors. This qualifier confirms what we have done and will continue to=
=20
do in practice; that is, evaluate individual performers against their peers=
. =20
It is possible, therefore, for someone to perform at the same or higher lev=
el=20
compared to prior periods, yet receive a lower rating for the current perio=
d=20
if other employees=01, performance raised the bar.
? Teamwork.  A relative ranking may invite the view that for one employee t=
o=20
gain, others must suffer.  However, feedback is explicitly solicited on=20
teamwork when evaluating each individual=01,s performance.  Anyone who atte=
mpts=20
to gain by withholding information or refusing to collaborate with others i=
n=20
the organization will suffer in a relative ranking on this key performance=
=20
criterion.
? Preferred distribution. In large part, the quality of our workforce has=
=20
been driven by our willingness to make tough decisions. We have consistentl=
y=20
captured business opportunities and overcome obstacles because we have made=
=20
the choices that had to be made in order to constantly improve our employee=
=20
talent base. The preferred distribution (5% superior, 30% excellent, 30%=20
strong, 20% satisfactory, and 15% needs improvement or issues) forces PRC=
=20
committee members to identify those who must improve in order to remain at=
=20
Enron as well as to single out top talent for special recognition. There is=
=20
some flexibility in the system, but every organization must ultimately face=
=20
this difficult question: have we achieved the highest level of performance =
or=20
are there still improvements that must be made? Few, if any, organizations=
=20
adhere exactly to the preferred distribution. Rather, they exercise informe=
d=20
discretion in the individual categories and meet a distribution that reflec=
ts=20
their groups=01, overall effectiveness and need for improvement.
? Communicating Ratings. Everyone rated =01&satisfactory=018 or below shoul=
d know=20
his/her rating. Each organization has determined for itself whether to=20
communicate ratings of =01&strong=018 and above.  In all cases, employees w=
ill=20
receive feedback about their performance against expectations, areas of=20
success, and areas that need improvement.

We hope this answers most of your questions about the PRC process.  We woul=
d=20
like your feedback and ideas on how to improve the PRC process going=20
forward.  Therefore, we will be conducting an eSpeak in the near future, an=
d=20
there will be other methods we will create to let us know what you think.  =
In=20
the meantime, please feel free to consult with your HR Generalist if you ha=
ve=20
any immediate questions, comments, or concerns.

Julie,

If they want to pay $5.15, that's fine with me.  I do have $5.11 in the 
system but I could
have easily made a mistake.  Let me know if you have any other questions.

Here is the draft procedures that I sent you back in September.  It does not 
incorporate the changes that you sent
us a few days latter.  I will forward a copy of that memo also.  We are 
looking forward to getting with you to discuss the 
procedures and timing.

Subject: Procedures for Incremental Empire Gas for On-Peak Day Ahead Market

Marty suggested that I get these discussions kicked off on your side while he 
was
out-of-town today.  Basically, I started off with your proposed procedures 
and made
a few changes that Enron needs to make sure that right amount of gas shows up 
at the
correct time.

Also, we are suggesting a confirmation form be sent back and forth between 
Enron and
Sithe every day.  This will help document all the small little details and 
costs so that we
both drop anything through the cracks.  I am suggesting that we e-mail this 
confirm form
to the right folks in both our companies, so that no one is left out of the 
loop.

You will also notice our attempt to make sure that everyone has a clear 
understanding
of exactly what is included in the numbers that are reported to Enron's 
traders.  The timing
of your calls will be when everyone is very busy in our trading group.  There 
will not be much
time to have long conversations, but it is very important that everyone have 
the same
understanding what the numbers mean.

Please take a look at this on your side and see if there are some other 
things that need to
be included.

Thanks,

Ruth

Sent: Wednesday, January 03, 2001 9:17 PM
Subject: Is it safe?

Lower interest rates doesn't mean you can buy  companies with broken and 
unproven businessplans, Amazon.? It also doesn't  mean u buy the Wintel 
monopoly because the pc revolution has been over for a  couple of years.? I'm 
working on a liquid crystal display company called  Applied Films because I 
think screens are future, not laptops, not pc's or  hardware companies in 
general.? Lower rates will not save Xerox.? What  lower rates does mean is 
that if a company is hitting on all cylinders the  market may give it a 40 
price to earnings ratio instead of a 30.? It may  get the short sellers off 
our back on names like Nextlink, now called XO  communications whose business 
plan works but who needs lenders to open up their  wallets again and this 
time only to real companies, sorry Webvan, Priceline,  Pets.com, and of 
course Amazon.? If these lenders weren't so burned with  this paper they 
might still be lending to the internet infrastructure names like  XO and 
Teligent.? The trillion dollar question is will multiple  appreciation 
compensate enough for the earnings slowdown in the next quarter or  two.? For 
the autos I think not.? Remember my comments two months ago  about Auto 
layoffs around the corner.? Today GM announced Dec. sales down  almost 20%.
??? This is a critical time in the  market for investors.? If we can find 
stocks who won't be affected by an  earnings slowdown, McDonalds, then we 
should start to get some multiple  appreciation and therefore higher stock 
prices.? If Oracle grows at 40%  instead of 50% but the market starts paying 
higher multiples for strong  companies we could also see Oracle move higher.? 
And lastly for telecom  names that do have a sound strategy and management 
team,access to capital should  appear somewhere down this new horizon.
??? My suggestions are as follows:  My largest new position is a research 
fund by Goldman Sachs that closes to new  investors at the end of Jan.? 
Typically technology and financial stocks  lead the market when the FED 
begins easing like they did today.? This fund  is 25% in tech and 25% in 
financials with other names in the fund including  Merck, Philip Morris,Tyco 
and Enron.? The Goldman list was positive last  year even with such heavy 
tech exposure and a Nasdaq? market that was down  almost 40%. I feel it's a 
nice way to participate in a market that has been hit  hard.? The remaining 
positions may not be for everyone but here are some  suggestions
?
??? Libery Media Group
??? McDonalds
??? Oracle
??? Philip Morris
??? Echostar???  
??? XO Communications
??? Omnicom
??? JDS Uniphase
???? 
Aggressive Ideas:
??? BEA systems
??? Redback Networks
??? Efficient Networks
??? Applied Micro  Circuits
??? Sibel Systems
??? Openwave  Communications
??? Comverse Technology
??? Avanex
?
Tax bounce idea:
??? Northeast  Optics

This is a message from Cindy Olson, Executive VP, Human Resource & Community 
Relations.

Please take a few minutes to complete the attached, very brief survey. Your 
input is important in helping determine future efforts in this vital area.

You have been randomly selected to participate in the second of an ongoing 
series of surveys that will be conducted to help us gauge how effectively we 
are leveraging diversity to enhance our organization.

As you know, Enron is engaged in a struggle to recruit and retain the quality 
of talent necessary to allow us to meet and beat our competition.  The 
business case for diversity is inarguable and we must step-up to the 
challenge of recruiting, developing and continually valuing an increasingly 
diverse workforce.  Such an effort requires that we look at diversity in a 
broader context that combines the different thoughts and ideas, life and work 
experiences, as well as skill sets of employees. It is this combination that 
will enable Enron to remain the leading innovator and one of the most admired 
companies in the world.

Thanks in advance for your cooperation and contribution.

Cherly,

I have been promoted out of the Associate program last PRC.  As a result, if 
you could take me off the Analyst/
Associate distribution list I'd deeply appreciate it.  Thanks and let me know 
if you have any questions or if you
haven't been notified of the promotion.

IN SPORTS TODAY:

After failing to secure a win via a recount of points, the Tennessee Titans
(6-7) are now demanding to replay the final down of their recent 42-41 loss
to the Dallas Cowboys (7-6).  Titan team officials explained that Titan
fans
intended for the final down field goal attempt to be good, and that
replaying the down is therefore justified despite the ruling of officials
that the ball did not pass thru the uprights.  Titan team officials added
that the width of the uprights confused kicker Al DelGreco (17yrs - Auburn)
on the 19 yard attempt and that the uprights should be widened for a replay
of the down.  Cowboys team officials countered that DelGreco had seen the
uprights before the game and had not complained to the officials.  They
added that Cowboy kicker Tim Seder (R - Arkansas) successfully kicked thru
the same uprights during the game from distances of 47, 42 and 36 yards.

Transaction Development, headed by Rodney Malcolm, works with Pulp & Paper,=

Lumber and Steel to structure and execute some of the more complex deals. =
=20
Members of the Transaction Development team have a strong track record of=
=20
closing structured transactions involving both capital and commodity risks.=
 =20
Sample deals would include working on the acquisition of Garden State Paper=

earlier this year, and structuring and pitching the first all requirements,=
=20
index based, physical steel supply contract to one of the largest players i=
n=20
the steel servicing segment of the steel industry.

The ability to buy and sell physical product will be critical to creating a=
=20
commodity product in these businesses.  Getting access to the physical=20
product will require creating compelling financing structures, as well as=

potentially buying assets to get control of their production capability.  I=

all these situations, the Transaction Development team will be a key player=

in driving these opportunities to closure.

TEAM CARLTON MAILBOX : ATTENTION MIKE DENZEL

We have received your acceptance and you are confirmed for ClickAtHome Pilot 
2.

You will be notified with an e-mail by November 17th on how and when you can 
access the ordering web site. Ordering is not expected to
begin until December. 

As a pilot participant, you will be testing various aspects of this new 
program such as the program offerings, program communications, product and 
service ordering, vendor services and program support.  At this time, the 
pilot program is not intended to provide access to Enron's network for 
telework purposes.   If you need Enron access for business reasons, please 
continue to maintain your existing computer and connection for this purpose.  
 In advance, we appreciate your co-operation and patience under this pilot 
program.  

Employees will have great options under this program for computers, 
peripherals, and Internet connectivity.   Your personal selections will 
determine your out-of-pocket expense, if any.  By participating the Pilot, 
you are not obligated to order hardware or connectivity, but will be given 
the opportunity to review your options and associated prices.

We know you are interested in more details.  However, one of our primary 
Pilot objectives is to test the communication on our web site.  We would like 
you to review more details about program offerings and related out-of-pocket 
costs, if any, once the pilot web site is available.  After agreeing to the 
Pilot Participants Agreement and reviewing these materials on the web site, 
you may choose to defer ordering until the All Employee roll-out in early 
2001 if you wish.

Please send any questions to the clickathomepilot2@enron.com mailbox.

Thanks.

Kevin,
 As we discussed, here are the changes I feel need to be made to the form 
before Enron North America Corp.  can agree to use it.

1.  Change 1.1 to read as follows:  This Agreement shall be effective upon 
its execution and shall continue in full force and effect through December 
31, 2000.

2.  Change 3.1 to read as follows:  Upon not less than 36 hours advance 
notification by Vector, Seller shall be obligated to sell and deliver to

Seller an amount equal to the difference between the price that would have 
been paid to Seller and the Gas Daily low price, set forth in Gas Daily under 
the heading "Daily Price Survey" under the listing applicable to Chicago and 
using the low price in the range of prices published for the day that Vector

Kevin,
 As we discussed, here are the changes I feel need to be made to the form 
before Enron North America Corp.  can agree to use it.

1.  Change 1.1 to read as follows:  This Agreement shall be effective upon 
its execution and shall continue in full force and effect through December 
31, 2000.

2.  Change 3.1 to read as follows:  Upon not less than 36 hours advance 
notification by Vector, Seller shall be obligated to sell and deliver to 
Vector, and Vector shall be obligated to purchase and receive from Seller, at 
the time stipulated by Vector in the advance written notification, at a Point 
of Sale, a quantity of gas equal to Seller's PSQ for such Point of Sale, as 
specified in Exhibit A to this Agreement.  The parties agree that time is of 
the essence in this Agreement..

3.  Add 4.2 to read as follows:  4.2  If Vector fails to purchase and receive 
from Seller the quantity of gas required to be purchased and received by it 
under Article 3.1 for any reason other than the occurrence of an event of

Seller an amount equal to the difference between the price that would have 
been paid to Seller and the Gas Daily low price, set forth in Gas Daily under 
the heading "Daily Price Survey" under the listing applicable to Chicago and

failed to perform multiplied by the volume Vector failed to purchase and

provided, such express remedy or measure of damages shall be the sole and

Dear Amazon Customer,

As someone who has purchased books about World War II and the men
and women who fought it, you might like to know about two recent
releases: "Our Finest Hour: The Triumphant Spirit of America's
World War II Generation" and Andy Rooney's "My War." These two
books, along with three related history titles, are now available
at 40% off. You can order your copies by following the links below:

"Our Finest Hour"
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1883013984/
"Life" magazine boasted an uncommonly talented roster of writers
and photographers during World War II. "Our Finest Hour" features
the images and reports that brought home to American readers the
horrors of that distant war, and also documents the efforts on the
home front. This selection of photographs and extended captions
from the pages of "Life" and other contemporary publications
gathers images that have become part of American iconography.

Andy Rooney's "My War"
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1586480103/
Andy Rooney's "My War," a fine and wholeheartedly irreverent memoir,
recounts his experiences as a correspondent for "Stars and Stripes,"
where he saw combat up-close while honing his craft alongside such
fellow chroniclers as Ernie Pyle and Bill Mauldin.

And, save 40% on these popular World War II-related titles:

"Flags of Our Fathers"
by James Bradley and Ron Powers
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553111337/

"The Greatest Generation"

Counnnnnnnnn,

What's up?   I heard Conway emailed you the other day about New Orleans.  I'm 
going to 
meet Conway and Jughead in N.O. on Nov 17 - 19 for a weekend getaway.  I just 
booked
my flight a couple days ago and wanted to see if there was any way you could 
make it
down.  It seems Conway has gotten a cheap hotel room with his military 
discount - one of the
perks of working for Uncle Sam.  I'm sorry for the short notice but we just 
decided to do it a 
few days ago.  If you could make it, we'd all love to see you.  If not, we'll 
have to get together
when I'm in NJ over Christmas.  Tell Chris we said hi.  Hope everything is 
going great for the
both of you.  Talk to you soon.

Kevin,

Sound advice.  I do think I am in the regret stage, though.  I just can't
believe that she could be so clueless as to the state of the overall
relationship.  In the grand scheme of things, we got along extremely well.
I think I just need to break contact with her for a while.

I was laughing about the Campi issue.  After I read your email I vaguely
recalled through the memories of the alcohol induced haze that was your
wedding weekend hearing Pattie refer to Rich as Kampmann.  But, even if I
had remembered it while writing the email, I would have opted for a C vice a
K.  Thankfully, I never had to learn English as a second language.  I would
have sucked!

Though it was nice to dream of a Porsche 911, I, like a good engineer,
returned to my sensibilities to purchased a '99 Saturn SL2.  It is dark blue
with gray leather and only 7400 miles.  I really liked the customer service
aspect and figured I needed every support network I could at a time like
this.  The worst part is that both of my parents have Saturns so it seems
like an old person's car to me.

Speaking of support networks, my mom is in town for 11 days.  She is like a
built in maid service.  I didn't know the house could be this clean!

Take care,

Frank

Sorry it's taken me so long to reply, but I just checked my email.  We were 
out of town the
last few days.  It sounds like you've been doing a lot of thinking and 
reflecting.   I think it healthy
to analyze one's actions in order to better understand oneself.  This better 
understanding, I find,
typically leads to self improvement and greater control, and ultimately, more 
happiness in life.
However, do not let it lead to any form of regret - that would be unfair.  We 
all have regrets, but
these regretted actions typically make us stronger and better people in the 
long run.  

I forwarded your email to Patty Kampmann, not Patti Campi.  As you might 
imagine, I got a kick
out of that.

Talk to you soon.

Kevin

FROM: Enron Human Resources


We are pleased to pass along to you the fact that United HealthCare (UHC) and 
Memorial Herman Health Systems (MHHS) reached agreement on a long-term 
contract.   There will be no disruption in terms of accessing network 
services from the hospital system or those providers who were scheduled to be 
terminated.  Employees currently electing UHC will receive a confirming 
letter shortly from UHC.

As mentioned in our earlier memo, it is our understanding that Cigna has also 
been contacted by MHHS and are now in contract negotiations. 

Open Enrollment packages are in the mail and you should consider the above 
facts when making your decision on your medical election.

TJ,

Thanks for the congratulatory message you left on our voicemail - it made us 
feel great.
We actually didn't go on a honeymoon - we will take one sometime next year.  
We've just
been swamped with the house we recently bought.  We bought an old small 
bungalow
in the city.  What a money pit.  Hope everything is going great.  Tell 
everyone we said
hi.

Thanks again,

Kevin

Kevin,

I can't remember the last time I was that relaxed!  On Sunday, Muggie asked
me in all seriousness if I had been smoking pot!

I spoke to a guy that said he spends 6-7k every 15-20k miles on ROUTINE
maintenance for his 911!  Unreal.  I have definitely scratched that one of
the list.

Looks like it is divorce court for this kid.  I can't believe it.  I am
actually disgusted by the whole affair.

How is that for an emotional swing in one email!

Have a great weekend!

Frank

The one thing I remember is that they are incredibly expensive and somewhat 
troublesome
to maintain.  Depending on how old it is, I definitely  wouldn't recommend it 
as your primary car.

Hope you had a good time at the wedding.  It was one of the best weekends 
I've had in ages.

Talk to you soon.

As a result of the team=01,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginn=

of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group.  This g=

The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary=20

We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001.=
 =20
This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical=
=20
temporary workers at the Houston locations only. If you currently have=20
administrative/clerical temporary workers in your department, the enhanceme=
nt=20
will not affect their position. In an effort to preserve relationships, all=
=20
current staffing vendors will be invited to participate in this enhanced=20
program.  CORESTAFF shares our commitment to minimize any disruptions in=20
service during this transition.=20
=20
We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha,=20
Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001.  T=
he=20
scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these tw=
o=20
phases have been completed.

Realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today, we=
=20
selected CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group based on their exceptional=
=20
management team, commitment to quality service, and creative solutions to o=
ur=20
staffing needs.  The relationship promises to offer Enron a cost effective=
=20
and simple means for obtaining temporary employees.

In the coming weeks, Enron and CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group will b=

Kevin,

 I received a statement from Wisconsin Gas that shows what we received at the 
different points from Wisc. Gas.  My understanding on the deal that we have 
with EES is that we only buy from Wisconsin Gas what EES requests from us.  
On the statement, I can match up what is in our system for all of the points 
except for Willow Run (Michcon).  The Wisc. Gas statement is showing that we 
purchased 13,291 dth on August 16.  I did not see anything come through for 
EES at this location so I asked Julie Boehl in volume management to look into 
it.  She did not see a brokered deal entered for EES at Willow Run.  EES is 
showing purchasing 11,408 from us (they may be incorrect on their volumes) 
and we are not showing any sales that match to this volume.  Could you please 
check into this for me and let me know if this is missing in the system?

Kevin - Just when you think it's safe to go back in the water!!  Mark Zwick 
at FirstEnergy called earlier.  I had called them last week after we found 
all the deals to make up for what they invoiced us for June's production.  We 
had some volume differences that Mark called to discuss.  On two of the deals 
(281431 and 308806), we have a total volume of 108,000 and 6,007 
respectively.  They invoiced us for 117,180 and 6,512. He claims our volumes 
are in mcf's and that if you apply the conversion factor of 1.085, you come 
up to his numbers.  The question is - who's right?? - Do we input mcf's in 
Sitara and if so, how can we get them adjusted to the dt's they invoiced us 
for?  And if our numbers are already in dt's, why does he think they're not?

The other thing is on deal #303253, we have a volume of 2,952 @ $3.26 where 
they invoiced us for 8,045 @ $3.835.  On this deal, he says our volume is an 
imbalance volume for MAY production (instead of June).  Could there still be 
another deal floating around out there for June's imbalance??  He says he got 
to that number by taking the total volume and subtracting out the other two 
deals (131,737 - 117,180 - 6,512 = 8,045).  He's supposed to be faxing me 
something to show that.  Would it be possible for me to bring that to you 
tomorrow sometime and maybe we can call him together to work all this out?

Sorry to keep harping on this but I'm sitting on a $600,000 receivable that's 
going to start drawing some attention.  Let me know if tomorrow afternoon 
would be convenient for you.

Thanks,
...Chuck

I appreciate the email.  I figured something must be wrong for you to miss 
the big day, but I was afraid to call.  The
important thing, obviously, is that you get better.  We'll just have to 
figure out a way to meet up with you in the near
future.  Tell everyone I said hi and keep me informed of your operation and 
recovery.  We'll all miss you very much.

Hugs and Kisses,

Kevin.

P.S.  Tell Tom and John we said hi.

Hi Kevin,

I tried to call you at work today, but you had already left.  I then tried
to call you at home but I have an old or wrong ph#.
I just wanted to say that I am so sorry I can't come to the wedding.  I was
actually coming by myself, because EVERYONE we asked to baby sit, couldn't
for that Saturday.  I was really looking forward to it.

The problem is that I am having problems with my episiotomy from the
delivery.  It has not healed properly and I am still having pain.
I won't know until my appointment next week, but the doctor said that I have
to go back in the hospital and get re-cut and re-stitched, and then I have
to wait to heal all over again.   I don't know all the details, but I am
assuming it will feel the same as it did just after the baby.  I was told I
couldn't do much of anything for about 2 weeks.  I asked to have the
procedure early, but they said I have to wait to heal completely or it may
not be strong enough to hold the stitches.

John's Baptism is on Oct 1, and my parents are coming up, so I need to have
it done 2 weeks prior to that, which puts your wedding right in the middle.
The  doctor said there was a slight chance it could heal on it's own, but it
is doubtful.

I just wanted to let you know that I am so bummed that I won't be there.  I
was so psyched to see Rich, Frank, Kampy and your family.   I'll let you
know if anything changes, but for now it looks like I'm going to miss the
most important day of your life!!!

Give me a call (856) 797-1398.

Thanks,
Karen

Alliance presented this to PGL when they were here on Tuesday (its the firm 
shippers primary deliver points).As an interesting note PGL interconnect will 
allow 600, but their system can't handle it.  We're working with our Canadian 
office to "buy" some of this alliance gas for PGL.  What we are looking at is 
reducing your baseload sale and part of their DIQ and replacing it with 
alliance gas.  We'll talk about it later.

Barbara,

I met with some people from Alliance Pipeline yesterday to discuss
nominations and confirmations.  Attached is a piece of information that
might be of interest to the daily group.  Could you route to the rest of the
group?

Thanks.

We are pleased to pass along to you the fact that United HealthCare (UHC) and 
Memorial Herman Health Systems (MHHS) reached agreement on a long-term 
contract.   There will be no disruption in terms of accessing network 
services from the hospital system or those providers who were scheduled to be 
terminated.  Employees currently electing UHC will receive a confirming 
letter shortly from UHC.

As mentioned in our earlier memo, it is our understanding that Cigna has also 
been contacted by MHHS and are now in contract negotiations.

Kevin,

 I received a statement from Wisconsin Gas that shows what we received at the 
different points from Wisc. Gas.  My understanding on the deal that we have 
with EES is that we only buy from Wisconsin Gas what EES requests from us.  
On the statement, I can match up what is in our system for all of the points 
except for Willow Run (Michcon).  The Wisc. Gas statement is showing that we 
purchased 13,291 dth on August 16.  I did not see anything come through for 
EES at this location so I asked Julie Boehl in volume management to look into 
it.  She did not see a brokered deal entered for EES at Willow Run.  EES is 
showing purchasing 11,408 from us (they may be incorrect on their volumes) 
and we are not showing any sales that match to this volume.  Could you please 
check into this for me and let me know if this is missing in the system?

Kevin - Just when you think it's safe to go back in the water!!  Mark Zwick 
at FirstEnergy called earlier.  I had called them last week after we found 
all the deals to make up for what they invoiced us for June's production.  We 
had some volume differences that Mark called to discuss.  On two of the deals 
(281431 and 308806), we have a total volume of 108,000 and 6,007 
respectively.  They invoiced us for 117,180 and 6,512. He claims our volumes 
are in mcf's and that if you apply the conversion factor of 1.085, you come 
up to his numbers.  The question is - who's right?? - Do we input mcf's in 
Sitara and if so, how can we get them adjusted to the dt's they invoiced us 
for?  And if our numbers are already in dt's, why does he think they're not?

The other thing is on deal #303253, we have a volume of 2,952 @ $3.26 where 
they invoiced us for 8,045 @ $3.835.  On this deal, he says our volume is an 
imbalance volume for MAY production (instead of June).  Could there still be 
another deal floating around out there for June's imbalance??  He says he got 
to that number by taking the total volume and subtracting out the other two 
deals (131,737 - 117,180 - 6,512 = 8,045).  He's supposed to be faxing me 
something to show that.  Would it be possible for me to bring that to you 
tomorrow sometime and maybe we can call him together to work all this out?

Sorry to keep harping on this but I'm sitting on a $600,000 receivable that's 
going to start drawing some attention.  Let me know if tomorrow afternoon 
would be convenient for you.

Thanks,
...Chuck

The attached file is an updated version of the one that I sent a few minutes
ago of the same name.   The changes are minor and are as follows:

*In the Daily Chg worksheet, the intraday change on BGE of +303 is all on
Choice+DCQ.  The original had 40 dth of the increase on Choice +DCQ and the
remaining 263 on EU 164, which was not correct.  No changes were made to the
volumes in the Total Reqs. worksheet which were correct in the original
version.

Sorry for any inconvenience.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  4/12  and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'TCO Storage':  Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its (paper) storage
injection for the month.    Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet
some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the
"Daily Change' worksheet.    Note that this worksheet is omitted pending
resolution of issues related to TCO storage.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for    and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'TCO Storage':  Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its (paper) storage
injection for the month.    Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet
some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the
"Daily Change' worksheet.     Note:  This sheet has been omitted from the
attached file for 04/11/00 pending resolution of issues related to TCO storage
with Chris Germany.

Attached is an updated version of the daily file that I sent earlier this
morning.  The only change is to the volumes for NIPSCO.  All other volumes
should be the same as those in the earlier version.  sorry for any confusion.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for 4/7  and
beyond.    There are three worksheets:  The one labelled 'Total Reqs' contains
the volumes that we need at each of the delivery points indicated.   The
schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at a
specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

The sheet labelled TCO stg shows daily swings on our paper TCO storage
injections.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  today and
tomorrow  .    There are three worksheets:  The one labelled with today's date
contains the volumes that we need at each of the citygate delivery points
indicated.   The schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas
is needed at a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be
ignored until further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is
archived on P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to
save a duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily citygate volume relative to a prior value.  For the 
current
gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the 
previous
day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 
3/28,
then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

The sheet labelled storage is for tracking our TCO storage injections (paper
injections).

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  4/20  and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are two  worksheets labelled as follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.

Friends,

Siddhartha, Nidhesh, and I are moving back home to Calcutta, India in April, 
2000.

Attached are our contact details.  I would have loved to contact each one of 
you directly but this has happened in a hurry and we have to pack, wrap up 
and leave Houston by April 20.  So please call to catch up and maybe plan a 
visit to Calcutta!

My work email and voicemail will remain active as I will be on a leave of 
absence from Azurix.  I will check them periodically.  Today is my last day 
at work. 

I hope that you will make to the happy hour that Gaby is planning next week. 
I would love to see you.

Regards,

-sheetal

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for   3/31 thru 4/3
.    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled with today's date contains 
the
volumes that we need at each of the delivery points indicated.   The 
schedulers
will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at a specific
point.    The AGL volumes are not current and should be ignored.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

Subject: April '00 FOM numbers for CES


Chris--Attached is the spreadsheet that we spoke of earlier today.  I have 
made
the correction to TCO Op 2, Mkt Area 20 into NYSEG (i.e. +854 dth/day).   I
will make the necessary changes to the AGL volumes over the next few minutes.
As we discussed, we'll need to resolve the question about Central Hudson off
Iroquois (we may not need any volumes there since Duke is the supplier), and 
as
I said, we'll be discussing our needs into southern Connecticut on a firm 
basis
with other suppliers.   I am also attaching the spreadsheet with the storage
injections for assigned storage.   I believe that we need to negotiate the
price for all of the  April storage injections.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  4/19  and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are two  worksheets labelled as follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.

Chris--The attached file contains the daily changes for 3/27 and 3/28 in the
volumes of gas that we need by market area.  The daily changes are relative to
what we requested on a First-of-the month basis, which values appear in Col.
DD.   You can just open this file and print it out to see the magnitude of the
changes by market area or zone.  We'll be calling regarding pricing.

Chris and Kevin--The attached file contains our latest daily volume
requirements for 3/20 and the rest of March.   One caveat:  I have included
here the additional 150 dth/day into Piedmont off Transco for 3/21-3/31.
However, we are still waiting on a price quote from Chris for that volume.  If
we end up getting that gas elsewhere, I will send you a revised spreadsheet 
w/o
the additional 150dth/day into Piedmont.

Steve--The attached file contains estimates for the upcoming 12-month period 
of
our monthly flowing volume requirements for the NIPSCO Choice program,
including estimated peak-day requirements (part of which come out of
storage).   I am referring to the values in Cols. L,M, and N in the attached.
Can you please give us a price quote for getting these volumes to the NIPSCO
citygate?

Please call me if you have questions.

Thanks.

Attached please find the nipsco changes for the 20th.  Please note that there 
is a change on the ANR leg from 200 @ ANR/Ft Wayne to 141 @ ANR/Ft Wayne and 
59 @ ANR/Michigan City.   This will balance your Pool B and make you take the 
withdrawal on Pool A.   Otherwise you would be injecting on Pool B and 
withdrawing on Pool A.  


Total Demand:    Nominated  Difference

Pool A  936   859   (77)     
Pool  B  141   141       0

Total  1,077   1,000   (77)

Also, please note that all changes for 4/21 thru 4/24 are due to be nominated 
on 4/20/00 since Nipsco is closed for the holiday on Friday so if you are 
increasing or decreasing volumes over the weekend I need to have those 
numbers no later than 9:30 tomorrow morning.


Thanks,


Cora

Attached please find a copy of volumes delivered to  Columbia Energy Services 
for March 1 thru March 9, 2000.  I downloaded this directly from Michcon's 
system  and the actual volumes Columbia received at each meter point is in 
the ADJ NOM VOLUME column.  It is broken out in what was delivered in dth and 
what was delivered in mcf.    I have also added a column to show the 
difference between what was delivered in dth vs mcf.   

We had numerous problems with nominations on Michcon's system for the dates 
of 3/2 thru 3/7, however Tom Butzon with Michcon worked very hard to make 
sure that all of our markets were kept whole.   After reviewing deliveries to 
CES per Michcon's system this is the breakout per day:

   Per CES Request  Per Michcon  Difference
3/1/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/2/00   11,417    11,240   (177)
3/3/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/4/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/5/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/6/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/7/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/8/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/9/00   11,450    11,450   0


I spoke with Tom this afternoon regarding the cut on 3/2/00 and he cannot go 
back and reallocate that point.    Regarding the increase for 3/8/00 it is 
imperative that Donna calls us to let us know that she sent an email due to 
the fact that we do not always have time to check email in time to get the 
gas put in the position for the next day.  Also in the event that someone is 
out and that person cannot check their email, a simple telephone call to the 
scheduler would help tremendously.  

Reqarding Doug's letter dated 3/7/00 regarding insufficient volumes at 
acceptable points for the Michcon Select Program, it is my understanding that 
a volume of 7,300 mcf is the requirement CES has to the Select Program.  On 
the attached spreadsheet I have broken out the points Enron delivered gas to 
CES on the acceptable points and we have met those requirements every day 
with the exception of 3/8 and 3/9 where Enron shorted CES volumes at required 
Map #'s by 272 mcf.  This was due to late changes we received by our 
suppliers.   If CES did incur penalties on 3/1 thru 3/7 then CES needs to 
look at how they are allocating each point since certain points are to be 
delivered to the Select Program first.   When CES receives all their points 
for the day they should first allocate the SELECT points to their SELECT 
customers, the remaining points  can then be divided up between their other 
non specific customers.   I apologize for the confusion but I believe we have 
made a valiant effort to keep CES whole at the proper points as best we 
could.  



Should you have any questions, please call me at 713-853-9138.

Responses:
1.  I'll let Kevin answer this one.  ANR and Michcon are Central Desk pipes.

2.  I would prefer to address all items on Exhibit 1.  If possible I would 
like to see the original Exhibit 1 volumes and updated Exhibit 1 volumes 
through March 2001.  However, I don't remember buying back any baseload gas 
on TCO for April.  I thought we priced everything at FOM IF and every day, we 
are buying back gas at GD - $.01.

3.  Are you doing a buy sell with Erron at the same price?  Does Duke bill 
CES directly for this?  

4.  See attached worksheets.

5.  I don't know all the information on the local production yet.  The 
pricing I'm currently using is the Exhibit 1 FOM deliverd pricing (pricing 
using ENA transport).  The attached April file has a Local Production tab.  
Molly Johnson is updating this information.  After she completes April, she 
will recreate Jan - Mar.

6.   Since the delivered pricing on TCO is the same, I'm not concerned about 
the individual citygate volumes.  For pricing purposes, I only care about 
total daily deliveries.   It would be a problem if you were trying to take 
additional gas from a non-constrained citygate to a constrained citygate and 
you don't have enough capacity.  This holds true for most other pipelines as 
well, Tenn Z6, CNG North Citygate, CNG South Citygate, ...  This would be a 
better question for Charlie to ask me when he is looking for something 
specific as it comes up.  The only thing I will not allow you to do is take 
gas from one pipeline to the other, Texas Gas Z4 to CGAS, and Colleen has 
discussed this with Melissa.

Subject: Questions


Chris--Below is a list of questions that we need to address fairly quickly.
Please look it over and let's talk.  The items are not prioritized in any way.

1-Enron's invoices show that for deliveries to Muncie (Indiana Gas) off ANR 
the
price index used is Michcon.citygate.GD.M.I.   The same is true for delivery
points into Michcon.   Is this correct, or are you actually using ANR ML-7 
plus
the Exhibit 1 increment applicable to Michcon?   Exhibit 1 specifies ANR ML-7
as the price index for Michcon.

2-CES has completely exited the following market areas/zones as of April 1:
TCO 6-11, TCO 6-12.   However, because Exhibit 1 contains projected volumes 
for
these two market areas in April 00, CES had to purchase from and resell to
Enron 90% of the April volumes contained in Exhibit 1.  Exhibit 1 contains
projected volumes for both market areas thru October 2000.   Are we required 
to
do a purchase/sell-back in each of these future months, or can we dispense 
with
this?  I refer you to Section 3.6 of the Gas Supply Assignment and Agency
Agreement (p. 11-12) as having some bearing on this issue.

3-The monthly volumes in Exhibit 1 off Iroquios into Central Hudson are
incorrect.  The 4,200 Dth is a monthly volume, not a Dth/day volume.  Since 
the
supply for this point is already arranged as a back-to-back with Duke Energy
and since Duke appears to be billing us directly for this gas, I do not intend
to do a simultaneous "buy/sell"  with Enron of the volumes in excess of the
(erroneous) Exhibit 1 volume.  If you disagree, let's discuss.

4-According to Exhibit 1, CES gets monthly capacity releases for TCO 4-21
(O&R),  TCO 7-3 (West Ohio), TGP Zone 6 (Boston Gas?), would you please 
provide
me with the Dth of capacity released to Enron as CES's agent on a monthly 
basis
for April at each of these points?   (I also need these numbers for January,
February, and March.)

5-How is the local production behind NYSEG, NFGD-PA, and CPA priced?

6-How will Enron invoice CES for daily swings on TCO in situations where gas
was merely being re-directed from one delivery point (where we were long for
that day) to another delivery point (where we were short)?


There will undoubtedly be other questions.  I will direct them to you as they
arise.

Thanks.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  4/18 and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'TCO Storage':  Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its (paper) storage
injection for the month.    Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet
some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the
"Daily Change' worksheet.    NOTE:  THis worksheet omitted pending resolution
of issues related to TCO storage.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  4/14  and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'COMMENTS' contains a (partial) list of day-to-day changes and issues of note.

We are pleased to present you with a 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Award.  As a participant in this grant you have the opportunity to share in the ownership of Enron and the potential profit from increases in the value of Enron's common stock.

The 2001 Special Stock Option Grant was made to let you know how valuable you are and to recognize your contributions in making Enron the great company it is today.   Although there are no guarantees as to Enron's future stock performance, we believe that an Enron stock option has tremendous future growth potential.  The value you ultimately receive from your options will depend on the price of Enron stock at the time you exercise your options.

Oh by the way,

Refresh my memory on how you got the call name of "sissy".  I am sure that there
is a perfctly sound reason behind this one?!?!?!?  Don't worry your masculinity
will never be in question with your boys out here on the left coast!  Maybe we
can get a lobby going to change your call name to "bamboo".

How well do you know our Code of Ethics?

"It is a condition of employment that each employee accept the responsibility of complying with the foregoing policies.  The Company will require each employee of the Company to complete and submit a statement in a form designated by the Company pertaining to such employee's compliance with the policies set forth in this booklet.  The Company reserves the right to request any employee to complete and submit such statement at any time or as frequently as the Company may deem advisable."
(Enron Code of Ethics, July 2000, page 62)

What does that mean?

In layman's terms, everyone employed by Enron agrees to all the policies and standards listed in the current Code of Ethics (July 2000).

Who does it apply to?

The Code of Ethics applies to all employees, third party contractors, guests and licensees of Enron.  Additionally, employees are responsible for their family members and/or personal household who use, own, or have access to Enron's communication services and equipment -- including telephones, fax machines, computers, computer modems, long distance telephone services, cell phones, voice mail, pagers, e-mail, mail and delivery services.

What about my privacy?

Don't expect privacy when using Enron's equipment or services -- whether the activity is business or non-business related.  For example, don't use Enron's equipment to send or receive personal messages that you don't want monitored or accessed by the government, third parties or Enron.  In a nutshell, if you want privacy, don't use Enron's equipment.

Are there repercussions for non-compliance?

Yes.  An employee who violates any of the policies in the Code of Ethics is subject to disciplinary action, including suspension or termination of employment, and can include legal action if Enron believes it to be appropriate under the circumstances.


If you have any questions or comments about IT security or a related issue, please feel free to put them into eMeet (http://nahou-lnapp01.corp.enron.com/eThink/eMeet.nsf) under the "IT Security" category.  We'll monitor the site and respond to you there.

For whatever reason (lower prices maybe?), we have experienced a huge increase in customer buying activity.  Other than the real small guys, we have been doing about 40 to 50 contracts a day of terms 1 to 5 years.  Today we have booked 112 and they continue to come in as I write.  If you are interested in our customer activity, let me know.

*** Springsteen visits Jersey Shore club

ASBURY PARK, N.J. (AP) - A legendary Jersey Shore rock club had a
special guest at its birthday party over the weekend: Bruce
Springsteen. The Boss made a surprise appearance Sunday night before
about 2,500 fans at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park. The show, which
marked the one-year anniversary of the club's reopening, featured
another shore favorite, Southside Johnny and Asbury Jukes, and
rocker Graham Parker. Springsteen showed up on stage at about 8:40
p.m. and performed with the band and Parker for about an hour. The
set featured several Springsteen songs and some Southside staples,
along with a cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Born on the
Bayou."

How was your little grab ass weekend with the Angel of Death?  Sorry to hear
about the house, I know what a bummer it is to lose a contract.  Hopefully
someone else will come along and take it off your hands.  Are you still
considering renting it or are you committed to selling?

My sister gave birth last weekend to a little boy, however he was about 4
months premature.  We're all pulling for him but it is still touch and go at
this point.

School is challenging but interesting and the flying is awesome so I'm
pretty happy.  Bought a used BMW motorcycle yesterday - a '71 off of the
original owner.  It's a classic and will give me something to tinker with on
the weekends.

Hope all is well,

The company-wide campaign kicks off on Monday and we would like to announce to the EWS organization that the EWS leaders have set the pace for a successful campaign exceeding our goal of $765,600.  Your contribution will help make this happen.

Thank you in advance for your participation.

Hello, My name is Hakeem Ogunbunmi, I work in Volume Management. Gloria Barkowsky and I are currently working on a project to properly identify Enron's responsibility regarding how fuel should be treated on Agency contracts. i.e. is Enron responsible for the fuel or not?  Using various sources, we have been able to identify most of these. The items highlighted in red on the attachment are those  that we still need some help on.

If you folks will be kind enough to take a look at these and let us know what information you have, we will greatly appreciate it.
 
Thanks

Chump,

Here's the cars I'd look at if I were you.

Acura 3.2 CSL
330i Coupe
Passat V6
Volvo S-80 or S-60 w/ twin Turbo
Audi A4/A6
Maxima (whatever the top of the line is - always top rated by Car and
Driver)

If you want American Iron, I'd look at the Chrylser 300M.  My uncle is a
huge driver and loves it.

Bharat,

I feel that my var has been overstated recently due to my recent purchasing
of gulf area basis.  As I've bought, my var has continued to increase dramatically.
I'm not sure of the reason, but typically gulf area basis rarely moves.  A $0.005
move is a rather dramatic move for example.  I spoke to Frank and he recommended
that I contact you so that you can do some investigation.  Below I've listed some of
the points I'm concerned with.  Please let me know your findings as soon as you can or
stop down (3233C) if you have any questions.  Thanks for your help.

Hi Kevin,

I have looked into your VaR question and, I don't think that your Var incerase is related to your Gulf Area Basis positions.  

Between the 13th and the 16th of July you bought about (484) fixed price contracts.   You went approx 4bcf shorter NYMEX, which increased your Var from about $500,000 to about $1,500,000 ($1 mm increase from one day to the next).  Between the above mentioned days the NYMEX prompt price fell approx 17 cents.  Yesterday you again seemed to have added about (3) bcf of NYMEX shorts on a down move of 14 cents in the prompt. MERC Prompot Vols are about 60%.....

So that's my take.......
I will look further into the problem if you still want me to.

Hope that helps

Thanks

Bharat

Good Morning!

Bottom line: No Changes.

For the near term (1-5), we see some cool anomalies arriving into the Dakotas by Monday already, with highs in the Dakotas in the mid-30s and lows in the mid-teens.By Tuesday, Texas and the Midwest will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low in the mid-40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight.  Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely.  Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation into the...

6-10 Day time period, which will see a cool shot over the Midwest/East towards next weekend, moderating again by early the following week. Then, early in the...

11-15 Day time period, more cool air moves in, beginning with central cooling, then even into the Southeast.

So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter.  Here's the strip beginning with today:

Sat 	11/17	47 Bcfd
Sun	11/18	52 Bcfd 
Mon	11/19	55 Bcfd
Tue	11/20	67 Bcfd
Wed	11/21	69 Bcfd

Sat	11/24	63 Bcfd
Sun	11/25	63 Bcfd
Mon	11/26	65 Bcfd
Tue	11/27	65 Bcfd

Good Morning! 
Bottom line: No Changes - Overall US conditions will return to a more normal late fall/early winter pattern (no Arctic air) over the next 2 days. This pattern will persist through the end of the month. 
For the near term (1-5): Bottom Line - Cooler weather will bring temperatures below normal from the beginning through the middle of the week in the Midwest and from the middle through the end of the week in the East and South. The below normal event will last 3 to 4 days before normal temperatures return. The Rockies and West will be normal to above normal with cooling by the end of the week.
Details: We see some cool anomalies arriving into the Midwest tomorrow, with temperatures in Chicago reaching highs late tonight and the mercury falling through the day tomorrow. By Tuesday, the South and Texas will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low 40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight. Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely. Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation.
6-10 Day Bottom Line: Variable conditions continue with a stormy pattern entrenched over much of the nation. Overall temperatures will be normal to cool with very wet conditions. NO strong Arctic air is expected.
Details: A strong storm will push into the West late next week and next weekend bringing heavy rain and snow and temperatures near to below normal. At the same time - the Midwest will warm toward normal with wet conditions developing. By early in the last week of November the strong western storm will push into the central U.S. bringing widespread rain and snow. Behind the system another surge of below normal temperatures will track from the Midwest to the South to the East.
11-15 Day a generally cool and wet weather pattern will persist over much of the nation. While NO Arctic air is clear on the horizon - temperatures on a national average will be cooler than normal and there will be an increased threat for rain and snow. 
So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter. Here's the strip beginning with today:
Sun 	11/18 	47 Bcfd 
Mon 	11/19 	54 Bcfd 
Tue 	11/20 	67 Bcfd 
Wed 	11/21 	69 Bcfd

Sun 	11/25 	62 Bcfd 
Mon 	11/26 	64 Bcfd 
Tue 	11/27 	63 Bcfd 
Till tomorrow,

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like "Industry Overviews" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.


IN THE NEWS

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
"We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,"  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

GMAT REVIEW AT ENRON

The next GMAT review course at Enron will begin the week of October 15th.
Two schedules are being offered:
	Course # 7129-00:  Tuesdays, Oct 16 - Dec 11 (no class Nov 20)
	Course # 7129-01:  Thursdays, Oct 18 - Dec 13 (no class Nov 22)
PLEASE NOTE that the two schedules are not interchangeable; employees should
enroll in their preferred schedule and stick to that schedule.

Course details:
	- Class is held at Enron in room ECN560 and is restricted to Enron employees
	- Each course is limited to eight students
	- Meets once a week for eight weeks
	- Hours are 6:00-9:00 PM (first session will run til 10:00 pm to
		include initial exam)
	- Expect 4-5 hours of homework per week
	- Course includes a total of four practice GMAT exams
	- Ends the second week of December, allowing employees to take the
		GMAT in December and meet a January application deadline.
	- Special discount of $200 off the regular Princeton Review tuition
Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
	1.  Print out the attached registration form.
	2.  Complete the form, but please note the following 
		SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
		A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
			your email address.
		B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says "Please enroll
			me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________", 
			please indicate either course #7129-00 (Tuesdays) or # 7129-01 (Thursdays).  
If you wish, you may indicate one course as your first choice and the other as your second choice.
		C.  In the Payment section:  For the course at Enron, the
			tuition is discounted by $200, to $899.  
			FULL PAYMENT of this amount by credit or debit card is required on the registration form.  
			Be sure to indicate complete cardholder information.
	3.  Fax the completed form to Princeton Review at (713) 688-4746.

Faxes are time-stamped by the receiving fax machine at Princeton Review.
The first eight valid registration forms received for each course will be honored.  
Registrations received after the first eight will be placed on awaiting list for the course or courses indicated.
Enrollments and waitlists will be confirmed by email.

Employees who are not able to take the course at Enron can take a course at
the Princeton Review office at the same $200 discount.  
The next courses at the Princeton Review office start the week of October 20.  
Call (800)2REVIEW to register or for future schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
	The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of your
application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can substantially
improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
	All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA Tour,
of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.  The
Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

	In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities.

	Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group.    

	Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group.

 Assurance & Business Advisory Services
Staff		Senior		Manager

Assurance and Business Advisory Services is the cornerstone
of Andersen.  In this practice, you'll learn how businesses
really work and gain in-depth business experience and 
knowledge.  Traditional audit services might have worked in
a traditional world, but that would no longer exists.  At 
Andersen, our capabilities go well beyond the traditional 
by focusing on clients' broader business issues and 
delivering a wider range of services that a dynamic 
business world requires.  At Andersen, you will become a

At Andersen, we have transformed our Assurance offerings to
help you meet important new challenges in these times of 
rapid changes.  Our Assurance methodology is squarely 
focused on risks and controls.  It is assurance for the new
economy.  Our Business Audit methodology begins by 
understanding a clients' business context and identifying 
business risks - the root causes of financial reporting 
surprises, misstatements and errors.  Once we have 
identified the risks, we focus on assuring the quality of 
key controls, so that our clients have confidence in the 
information they rely on to run their business, that that 
others rely on to invest in it.  We are enthusiastic about 
the role of assurance and its ability to deliver value to 
business leaders and the investing public.  Assurance is a 
growing business at the heart of Andersen.  For every 
client and company, it is a fundamental and increasing need.

Drive 'em both, but at least for the older one's the 8 cyl was MUCH
smoother.  It really comes down to what you want.   Unless you're really
pushing it you won't notice much of a difference.  However, what you will
notice is that the 6cyl will be working a lot harder (i.e. louder).  Once
you jump into the 5 you're in the luxury market and you probably want a
smoother car with plenty of torque (8 cyl).  Especially the way you drive
(not winding the engine out in every gear) you'll feel more low end power in
the 540.  Again, it comes down to the pax.  If you're hauling 2 most of the
time, the 530 is probably fine;. hauling 4 it will be sucking wind a bit.
Remember when you're on a test drive the car isn't configured the way it
will be in real life.  The tires will be under inflated, the gas tank (large
in that car, like 14 gal ~90 pounds) and no passengers so your performance
will seem better.  My best advice when looking at cars in that price range
is to insist on an extended (overnight or over a weekend) test drive of
both.  You don't want to buy and wish you had bought the other a couple of
weeks later.  Finally, think about long term (kids, etc) if you plan on
hanging onto it as long as the Miata.  It's not uncommon for a bimmer to go
2-300,000 miles without engine work so you can hang onto them for quite a
while if you stay up on the maintenance.  Give me a buzz at home
(301.737.5366) tonight if you want to yap about it.

What do you think about the 530?  Isn't it basically the same thing
as the 330 except it's bigger?  If so, does it handle as well with the
added size and weight?

Kev,

Real quick on the cars.  The beamer is real tight in the back seat.
Think
about how often you might be hauling 3-4 people.  If you think it's a
factor, spend some time on an extended test drive sitting in the back.
I'd
still look at the Vovlvo S-60 twin turbo, it might surprise you.

I was at the game last night sitting in home run territory - section
154.
It was one of the most disappointing games i've ever attended.  the
astros
don't even deserve to make the playoffs after their cowardly play.  the 
manager's an idiot - intentionally walking Bonds with guys on 1st and
2nd
with 2 outs.

Anyway, in terms of the Miata, the dealer recommended abt $1300 worth of
work.
Of course i told him to just get the thing running ($450).  The problem
is
the blue book value is only $2500 so i can't see putting another grand
into it.
I'll probably just sell it to someone who races miata's (which is really
big
in Texas) or donate it to charity and take the tax write off.

We haven't test driven anything yet but it looks like we're leaning
toward the
BMW 330i.  It seems to get great reviews, the main downside is that it's
a little
small - but still sporty.  We'll go for test drives this weekend and
should buy
or lease (still undecided) something in the next couple weeks.

How's everything on your front.  Less classroom time and more flying
time???

That faggot Lowery was in Austin this past weekend.  I don't expect him
to call
of course but it shows how easily he could've gotten to Houston while he
was 
working for 8 mos. in Dallas.

Later,

kevin

fixed or are you just abandoning it?  Where are you leaning in terms of
a
new car?  On my end, the classic motorcycle is buzzing like  a champ and
a
complete blast to drive.

What's with the faggot Astro's walking your boy?  At least he pocketed
one
record.

I don't have TJ's email w/ me, but I'm sure he never expected you to
actually show up in the first place.

Conway,

Do you have T.J.'s new email address.  I want to let him know I
won't be out there in Oct.  Give me a shout.  How's everything going?

My miata broke down this past weekend.  I didn't think it would be
that soon.  It looks like I'm forced to buy a new car.  I'm not 
looking forward to the process although the internet should make
it less painful than it was 9.5 years ago.  Wow, I can't believe
I've owned the Miata for over 9 yrs.  

I'm going to see Bonds play on Wednesday night.  Hoping he'll be
going for the record that night (either a tie or to break it).  I
scored tix in section 154 - prime bonds territory.  Check out the
section on the Houston Astros website.

Talk to you soon.

Kev,

Real quick on the cars.  The beamer is real tight in the back seat.  Think
about how often you might be hauling 3-4 people.  If you think it's a
factor, spend some time on an extended test drive sitting in the back.  I'd
still look at the Vovlvo S-60 twin turbo, it might surprise you.

I was at the game last night sitting in home run territory - section
154.
It was one of the most disappointing games i've ever attended.  the
astros
don't even deserve to make the playoffs after their cowardly play.  the 
manager's an idiot - intentionally walking Bonds with guys on 1st and
2nd
with 2 outs.

Anyway, in terms of the Miata, the dealer recommended abt $1300 worth of
work.
Of course i told him to just get the thing running ($450).  The problem
is
the blue book value is only $2500 so i can't see putting another grand
into it.
I'll probably just sell it to someone who races miata's (which is really
big
in Texas) or donate it to charity and take the tax write off.

We haven't test driven anything yet but it looks like we're leaning
toward the
BMW 330i.  It seems to get great reviews, the main downside is that it's
a little
small - but still sporty.  We'll go for test drives this weekend and
should buy
or lease (still undecided) something in the next couple weeks.

How's everything on your front.  Less classroom time and more flying
time???

That faggot Lowery was in Austin this past weekend.  I don't expect him
to call
of course but it shows how easily he could've gotten to Houston while he
was 
working for 8 mos. in Dallas.

Later,

kevin

As you are aware, there have recently been a number of virus attacks released and spread across the Internet. Although Enron continually readdresses and updates its virus protection procedures, new viruses will continue to be released and pose a threat to Enron's computing environment. Therefore, it is very important that all Enron employees understand their responsibilities in helping Enron stay virus free. 
If you receive a file via Email or any other means and you are unfamiliar with the sender or the purpose of the file, please do not automatically open/launch the file. One of the key elements of a virus attack is the innocent nature of its delivery.
Viruses can cause a significant amount of damage, including data loss and service outage. Viruses such as the Melissa, ILOVEYOU, AnnaKournikova, and the recent Nimda virus, caused organizations billions of dollars. Sometimes new viruses can breach the environment before the virus scanning software has been updated to detect & quarantine them. 
Every employee in the Enron organization has a responsibility to keep our computing environment virus-free.
If you believe you have a file that looks suspicious, delete it or contact your Resolution Center to obtain their assistance.

================================== 

Who We Are

Cornerstone Research is a leading financial/economic 
consulting firm that specializes in providing attorneys 
with expert testimony and economic and financial analyses 
in all phases of commercial litigation. Our staff of more 
than ninety consultants works closely with prominent 
faculty at many top universities.  Our work includes 
developing economic and financial damages models, 
conducting market research to analyze driving forces behind
business successes and failures, and supporting experts in 
writing expert reports and preparing for trial testimony.

Cornerstone is involved in a broad variety of cases.  We 
analyze factors affecting the stock and option prices of a 
company, study the impact of regulatory changes on the 
development of an industry, determine the effects of a 
firm's activities on its competitors, and research 
historical merger and acquisition events.  Our work has 
involved highly visible events and legal issues.  Some of 
our recent cases have examined the failures of many 
Internet high-tech ventures, the collapse of the savings 
and loan industry, price fixing, insider trading, and large
corporate mergers.  Our clients come from a variety of 
industries, such as commercial and investment banks, 
consumer goods producers, and leading technology and 
telecommunications firms.
For further details, check our website at 
http://www.cornerstone.com/

Associates at Cornerstone

Associates are central to case work at Cornerstone.  In the
initial stages, associates actively participate in the 
formulation of the work plan and the analysis of issues.  
As the case progresses, associates handle the complex 
aspects of a case directly, while managing and advising 
analysts.  They work with senior staff, experts, and 
clients to develop case strategy and to determine how best 
to communicate our findings.  An associate's 
responsibilities include:
? Identifying key economic and financial issues
? Conducting in-depth research and analyzing relevant data
? Creating analytical frameworks, and building economic and
financial models
? Presenting complex findings to counsel
? Participating in the preparation of expert reports, 
declarations, and other work product

Company Culture

We provide friendly and cooperative working environment.  
Even with the significant growth over the last couple of 
years, we have maintained a non-hierarchical collegial 
culture.  We recruit associates with a long-term 
development perspective instead of 'up-or-out' mentality.  
Associates are encouraged to take initiatives and 
leadership roles in both case work and company business 
development.

Candidate Profile

Our current associates and managers include MBAs from 
Stanford, Chicago, Duke, Wharton, Yale, Carnegie Mellon, 
etc.  The ideal candidate should have the ability to 
develop structured case-cracking strategies and creative 
solutions, present concise explanations of complex 
analyses, and independently manage projects and junior 
staff.  Candidates should have strong background in 
finance, accounting, or economics, as well as strong 
communication and writing skills.  We offer 
industry-competitive compensation.
Interested candidates should send a cover letter which 
includes your location preference (we have offices in Menlo
Park, CA, Boston, MA, New York, NY and Washington, D.C.), 
and a resume to:

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

Kevin I have a call into Wendy Lebroc ( 713.853.3835 ) in your credit
department explaining that Enron trades Dawn as Enron North America not
Enron Canada - awaiting a call back from her.  Just wondering if you had
heard from her as to what was going with us being able to trade Dawn on
EOL...

Time is quickly approaching for Gas Trading to move into the Enron Center South building.  The scheduled date for the move is Friday, November 9, 2001.  The Enron Center South does not have the capacity of our current building for filing space.  I am suggesting that all of you go through your current files and discard any old files that are no longer useful to you.  If you have files that need to be sent to archive or need files made, let Alex or myself know and we will take care of you.


Thank you,

Irena Hogan

Once again it is time to begin the nomination process for Enron's Chairman's Award.  

For those of you who are new to Enron, the Chairman's award is an employee-driven award designed to recognize Enron employees who make a difference in our organization by demonstrating our core values - Respect, Integrity, Communication, Excellence - in everything they do.  These individuals are the Everyday Heroes who make Enron a great place to work. They capture the spirit, the philosophy and the day-to-day business practices of our company in their work, their attitude and how they regard their colleagues.  

This award program will only be as successful as your participation in it.  All Enron employees can nominate fellow employees at any level - from the top down or the bottom up.  

Nomination forms will be available around the world.  Find the forms on your intranet site or at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  Direct any questions to mbx_chairmansaward@enron.com

The nomination process is simple.  Complete and submit the nomination form by Wednesday, October 10, 2001.  This year's Selection Committee will then review all nominations and present recommendations to the Office of the Chairman for final approval.

The Chairman's Award winner and finalists will be announced at the annual Enron Management Conference in San Antonio, Texas on November 16, 2001. 

I want to personally encourage each of you to think about your colleagues, their contributions to Enron and their adherence to our values.  If there is someone you know who is one of our many "everyday heroes" and you think they deserve to be recognized for their dedication and commitment to Enron's values, now is your turn to speak up?so please take the time to nominate someone you know for this very special award.

I look forward to learning more about our outstanding employees here at Enron and thank you for your participation.

	Dear Valued Client,	 	
The recent tragic events have left us all with many questions. I wanted to take a moment to share with you my thoughts on the events on Tuesday and their impact on the future. Through this all, we will keep the victims and the families affected by this tragedy in our prayers. 	  <http://schwab.ed4.net/htdocs/images/88x103_Chuck.gif>	
As the situation around the world unfolds, we will continue to keep you apprised of the actions we are taking to make sure that your interest as our valued client remains uppermost in our minds. Schwab.com <http://schwab.ed10.net/ud/BIM9/5ACA/WB13/50/D43D6H> will be updated regularly as news and information changes.

Personal letter from Charles Schwab, founder <http://schwab.ed10.net/ud/PTRG/RUNN/BW72/RF/D43D6H>

	

We stand ready to serve you and conduct business as normal, providing the market wisdom and support you need most. We are working closely with the stock markets, federal government, regulators and other members of the financial services community to ensure America's financial markets return to normal. 	
	
I continue to believe a long-term approach is the wisest course of action, although I do recognize that some short-term volatility will likely occur when markets reopen. Please consider this in placing orders prior to market reopen.	 
My advice to you is the same investment advice I have offered clients for over 40 years: invest for the long term and maintain a diversified portfolio--and stay calm during the rough times. 	
We know that each individual's situation is unique. I encourage you to explore our web site, visit a Schwab office, or call us at 1-800-435-4000 with any questions. We stand ready to assist you with all of your financial services needs during these challenging times.

	
	
Thank You,

Wow!  Enron employees and other Houstonians are showing such generosity!  

The response to the blood drive has been outstanding.  Employees from Continental Airlines and other surrounding corporations have come to our blood donation site to give.  Blood Center personnel have informed us that because of the overwhelming response donations are now being taken on a first-come, first-served basis.  The Blood Center is attempting to keep appointments on schedule.  However, we ask for your patience and understanding if there is a delay. 

It is indeed gratifying to witness your continued generosity to the community and beyond.

Dear Schwab Client:

As of Thursday September 13, 2001, SchwabFunds(R) Money Funds will
be open for Shareholder transactions and will continue to be
open for business each day that the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York (the "Fed") is open. This change to the Schwab Money Funds'
business days is designed to provide shareholders the ability to
access their cash investment while the New York Stock Exchange
("NYSE") remains closed. Typically, the Schwab Money Funds are
open for business only on days that both the Fed and the NYSE
are open. 

To perform a Schwab Money Funds transaction, please call
1-800-435-4000 or your Signature Services Team. You will not be
able to place transactions on the Schwab.com website or through
Telebroker(R). 

This action is subject to change. Charles Schwab Investment
Management, Inc., the Funds investment adviser, will continue to
monitor this situation closely and provide updates as necessary. 

Sincerely,
Jeremiah H. Chafkin
Chief Operating Officer
The Charles Schwab Family of Funds

The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday.
To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund.
Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1.

How to Help
?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on "Disaster Relief"  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. 

?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website.  

?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. 

?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of "National Prayer and Remembrance," and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information: 

o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/> 
o	<http://www.chron.com/content/community/religious/>
o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon.  
o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. 


?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking.  

?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers.  

?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday.

For Counseling Assistance
?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. 

?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need.

This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

Due to the overwhelming response from Enron employees and contractors, today's blood drive appointments are completely full, and there are a large number of you who still wish to donate blood.  We are working diligently with the M. D. Anderson Blood Bank to schedule another day for blood donations, and you will be notified as soon as that date is secured.  For those of you who are interested in giving, please continue to either call the Enron Health Center, ext. 3-6100, to get your name on the waiting list or go to the donation line in front of the building.  We recognize and are grateful to the many of you who are wanting to give blood today, but ask that you be patient and understand our inability to accept walk-in donations at this time.

As most of you know, American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston to Los Angeles was hijacked yesterday and then crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center in New York.  We are very sorry to report that we believe an Enron employee was on board that flight.   Nick Humber, a director in Enron Wind's commercial origination group, was listed on the flight's manifest, and although his family has not received official confirmation that he boarded the flight, they have been unable to contact him.  Nick was based in Boston and was traveling to Los Angeles for a meeting.  We have talked with Nick's family and offered our full support.  Please continue to keep Nick's family and everyone affected by this horrific event in your thoughts and prayers.

In light of the tragic events in New York City and Washington, DC, there is a national call for blood donations.  Enron is taking two actions:

	1.	The City of Houston is sponsoring a city-wide blood drive at the George R. Brown Convention Center today.  For your convenience, Enron is providing transportation to and from the Convention Center from 9am-3pm.  Transportation will be leaving from the Enron Building every half hour.  We have been informed that there is a 3 - 4 hour wait.  

	2.	Enron's regularly scheduled blood drive is being held on Thursday, September 13, from 7 a.m. until 4 p.m.  Two mobile units from the M. D. Anderson Blood Center will be parked outside the Enron Building on Andrews Street to accommodate donors.  Call the Enron Health Center at ext. 3-6100 to schedule an appointment.  Information regarding Enron's blood drive program and eligibility criteria is location on the Wellness webpage http://hrweb.enron.com/wellness/healthService/bloodDrive.asp 

Our latest information is that three busloads of Enron employees have already been taken to the Convention Center and many of you have already scheduled appointments for Thursday.  We commend all of you for your community spirit.

re feedback from this thing:
the guy who bob knows who was  looking wanted to get people from outside to really build up the business...the other co-head wanted to concentrate on internal moves to see if they could start with an option capacity and build it up later .....the second guy won....
so not a decision that reflected the resumes put forward, but a focus on internal politics.....

just wanted to let you know

are you going to france for honeymoon?

i found out george taking me to california for our anniversary......what are the names of your favorite wineries.....we really should do a joint trip next time....

spk soon
hope you are well - best regards to lisa

It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) Walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, October 28th, at Greenspoint Mall.  I continue to serve on the board of JDRF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDRF again this year.  JDRF is a very efficient organization in which approximately 85% of all money raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise $400,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 6 years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the walk this year is "Mission: Possible" and we would like to have you join us for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 600 Enron people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included in the first important and informative training session taking place this week.  In addition, you may go to cr.enron.com and sign up as a volunteer online if you prefer.

Thank you very much for your support.

Enron Federal Credit Union
E-Survey Response

We recently asked you to participate in the EFCU 2001 E-Survey.  More than 3,000 Enron employees took the time to respond to our survey.  Your honest opinions and time are appreciated and will help us continue to bring you products and services that you deem important in your life, as well as the service that you expect.

We are pleased to report these areas where you have had a positive experience (based on Good, Very Good, and Excellent ratings), in comparison to last year's ratings:

				2001	2000
	Friendliness		88%	84%
	Courtesy		89%	84%
	Knowledge/Training	86%	80%
	Range of Services	87%	82%
	Saving Interest Rates	66%	60%
	Loan Interest Rates	65%	58%
	Quality of Service	88%	84%
	Communications	84%	79%
	Web Portal		72%	N/A
	Service Wait Time	79%	68%


Of course, there is always room for improvement.  Based on your written comments, we have determined these areas where we would like to improve:

ATM Access - We are working with various vendors to develop a program that offers you more free ATM access options and hope to be able to offer this program soon.  We will let you know as soon as a program is available.  In the meantime, members are encouraged to get cash one of these ways to avoid fees:

-  Use your VISA Check Card to get cash back at merchants.  These are fee-free transactions.
-  Use our ATM in the lobby of the Enron Building or 3 Allen Center, or try the approximate 100 fee-free ATMs in the Houston area that display the Select ATM logo (visit enronfcu.com for locations).	
-  Visit one of our Service Center branches (visit enronfcu.com for locations).
-  We will also waive our fee on 3 unaffiliated ATM transactions per month.


Phone Accessibility - In January 2001, we established a phone center to answer incoming calls to our main number.  An automated system initially prompts you, but the option to speak to a live operator is available.  Your call may be forwarded to an EFCU representative, and you may get voice mail.  In this instance, we will return your call as soon as possible.

Should you get voice mail, it will help us process your request more efficiently if you leave your name, phone number, member number and the nature of your call.  You may also contact us via e-mail at efcu@enron.com, and we will respond as soon as possible.


Wait Lines - Unfortunately, due to space constraints, we are unable to expand our financial services area (new accounts) right now.  We do recognize that this does at times cause a back up and apologize for the inconvenience.  We are making plans to expand when possible.

We added several tellers this year to help the traffic flow in the teller area and are now filled to capacity at all stations.  As you know, the teller lines are sometimes heavy on paydays.  To help minimize your wait time, here are a few other options to handle your transactions:

-  Make deposits & withdrawals at our ATMs in the Enron Building Lobby or 3 Allen Center.  Deposits are retrieved between 2:30 and 3:00 p.m. and are posted the same day.
-  Make deposits at our Night Drop Box on the 3rd floor of the Enron Building, outside of the EFCU front doors.  The Night Drop Box is checked throughout the day and transactions are posted the same day if received by 5:00 p.m.
-  Sign up for Direct Deposit.  It's convenient, fast and safe.  Go to ehronline.enron.com to sign up.
-  Sign up for QuickLink - Internet Account Access.  QuickLink is free and allows you to verify cleared checks and posted deposits, transfer funds and more, all from the convenience of your computer.  Sign up at enronfcu.com.
-  Sign up for QuickTeller - Automated Phone System.  QuickTeller is also a free service that allows you to perform all of the same functions as QuickLink, but by telephone.  Go to enronfcu.com to sign up.

Thank you again for your feedback.  We look forward to the opportunity to bring you more of the latest financial services as they become available in the market.

That test pilot actually lived.  I saw an interview with him on 60

Stacey - 

Below are two e-mails sent to you on their respective dates. I think we are 
ready to push on with the ANR ML7 Delivery Location and have suggested some 
language based on comments from Kevin (e-mail dated 5-12). Kevin has called 
and asked for this product. Please offer comments/approval.


5/31/00

I spoke with Mark Schrab in Logistics about the ANR ML7 Product that Kevin 
Ruscettit would like to start trading and he wasn't able to dispell any 
beliefs that this is a product that should not be traded, OTC or otherwise.

Mark explained that often times on this pipe there were cuts due to 
operational constraints. I explained that we had drafted language to 
contemplate these occurances. I then asked Mark what would happen if there 
was a cut due to op constraints, and Mark explained that he would try to find 
another Buyer along the pipe. I probed further, and found that there would be 
no revision of the contract, nor a re-pricing of the transaction due to the 
re-scheduling. I then read Mark the language under consideration (making sure 
he understood that this was conceptual) and he agreed that the language 
provided for something that we are already doing operationally. Mark had 
never seen the language we propse for use for this Product. 

I think Logistics may have been issuing an opinion on their point without 
being fully aware of what we were attempting to offer, and I certainly don't 
blame them for doing so - as we all make decisions based on the information 
at hand.

I would like to proceed with this Product.

Dale

5/12/00

I spoke with Kevin Ruscetti, the trader, and Kevin has clarified for me that 
the product he intends to trade on ANR ML7 is NOT Interruptable gas, but 
rather subject to operational constraints like Socal Topock. He did request, 
however, that we make reference to secondary firm delivery.

Below please find the op constraints language that we use. I also added a 
secondary delivery blurb; please feel free to edit - and then I'll get this 
in front of Kevin for his review.


The transaction is for delivery at the ANR Pipeline Company ML7 
interconnect.  The volumes scheduled to be 
delivered are subject to reductions due to normal operational constraints on 
the ANR Pipeline Company pipelines 
based upon historical operating conditions.  The reductions caused by these 
constraints are excused 
nonperformance and are not considered a failure to receive or deliver firm 
gas. In the event that the volumes 
scheduled are reduced due to such normal operational constraints occur, Buyer 
may designate 
a secondary firm delivery location.

Please forward this on to Mike and Kevin.  The turnaround time is rather
quick so you probably should contact this person directly to tell him that
you will be coming and sending a check to the address referenced in the
invitation.  Just tell him that you received the invitation from Kara Kinder
Howes (my cousin) and David Kinder.  Kara is one of the hosts of the event.

Hey bro

What is happening?! Fishing stuff is coming along. The charter is set for
Sept. 22nd in the A.M. departing from point pleasant. Capt. Gene will get
back to me in a week or so with more details.

The cost is $50 per person. No bottles allowed but you can bring cans or
cups. I've got the beer and drinks. Also pack food. Trip should be about 8
hours.

Contacted Rich Moeller and let him know about the time and specifics. It
looks like 14 people are going with the possibility of about 20 (5 are still
undecided). Should be a good time.

If you have some e-mail addresses for Rich or Rosigliano or a couple of
other people please supply them to me so I can keep everyone posted on the
details.

The big date is less than 4 weeks away (Can you believe it?)

Hope all is well,

Keith

Sounds great.  Moller's email address is Richard.J.Moller@marshmc.com.  I do 
not have anyone else's email,
but Moller should be able to provide you with Coun's and Ricigiliano's.  Just 
ask him.  Let me know if you need anything
else.

Thanks,

Kevin

Chump,

Long time no hear.  Sorry it's taken me so long to touch base with you.  
Between work, the wedding,
and the fact that we just purchased a house (pending inspections) I've been 
pretty stressed.
As far as the wedding goes Lisa and I have decided to scale down 
considerably.  We're only going
to have immediately family and the folks in the wedding party.  For me that 
includes you of course, Moller,
Kampy and Peremes (even though she won't be in the wedding).  Don't tell her 
though, she's the only
one I haven't mentioned anything to.  I'll make sure you and Moller get to 
share a room.  I feel kinda bad
about not inviting Lowery since I was in his wedding, but I don't feel like 
dealing with Kim.  She's really 
annoyed me the last few times I've seen her.

We still plan on having it at the B&B in Long Beach Island.  We'll have a 
catered dinner for about 45 folks.
It should be more manageable and cheaper this way.

Do you have the exact date when you'll move back to the states?  I'm psyched 
you'll be a lot closer.  You
could swing over to Houston and check out the new house.  By that time we 
should have it in decent shape.
We bought the ugliest, most beat-up house on the block.  It definitely needs 
a lot of work.  We'll be busy for
the next year working on it.  I think when it's done,  it'll look pretty cool.

Anyway,  send me an email and let me know how everything's going and when 
you'll be back.  Take care and
tell Marie we said hi.

Kevin

Ahn-yong-ha-sae-yo Anderson team,
Looks like I'll be missing the fall recruiting activities in L.A.  I trust 
all is going well, and that we should continue our success at Anderson.  I 
would hope the dot com fever has died down somewhat, plus I think Enron has 
quite of bit of upside to offer candidates in that so much of what we do now 
is new economy without as much risk as a pure dot com.

Life in Seoul is working out quite nicely.   My wife Sunnie and I are finally 
settled into our townhouse in Sungbuk-dong, next to Pukhansan National 
Park.   Almost all of Korea is mountainous and we can find trails everywhere 
in and around Seoul.  Work is going very well.   I'm in charge of new 
business development at the SK-Enron joint venture so I've got my team 
working on about half a dozen initiatives.  I am currently busy preparing for 
the launch of a B2C website catering to consumers and their household 
needs.   I'm also leading a pilot project to lay some fiber optic cable along 
our gas pipeline network.  Summer monsoons have finally stopped, and we're 
looking forward to a trip down to Pusan during Chuseok (Korean 
thanksgiving).  Sunnie, daughter Heather and I spent a week in the mountains 
near Seoul, quite beautiful.    Let me know how the recruiting progresses, 
and also what's been going on in Houston.  

Cheers,
Jung

It's time to say farewell. Next Thursday will be my last day at Enron, as I 
will be leaving to pursue other opportunities. Over the years, I appreciated 
the opportunity to work with, to learn from and get to know all of you and 
hope we can stay in touch (my email address is finanseer@hotmail.com). I hope 
those in Houston can join me at Solero's after work on Thursday, Sept. 7 
(Deffner's buying!!).

Take care,
Matt

Hi Kevin,

I tried to call you at work today, but you had already left.  I then tried
to call you at home but I have an old or wrong ph#.
I just wanted to say that I am so sorry I can't come to the wedding.  I was
actually coming by myself, because EVERYONE we asked to baby sit, couldn't
for that Saturday.  I was really looking forward to it.

The problem is that I am having problems with my episiotomy from the
delivery.  It has not healed properly and I am still having pain.
I won't know until my appointment next week, but the doctor said that I have
to go back in the hospital and get re-cut and re-stitched, and then I have
to wait to heal all over again.   I don't know all the details, but I am
assuming it will feel the same as it did just after the baby.  I was told I
couldn't do much of anything for about 2 weeks.  I asked to have the
procedure early, but they said I have to wait to heal completely or it may
not be strong enough to hold the stitches.

John's Baptism is on Oct 1, and my parents are coming up, so I need to have
it done 2 weeks prior to that, which puts your wedding right in the middle.
The  doctor said there was a slight chance it could heal on it's own, but it
is doubtful.

I just wanted to let you know that I am so bummed that I won't be there.  I
was so psyched to see Rich, Frank, Kampy and your family.   I'll let you
know if anything changes, but for now it looks like I'm going to miss the
most important day of your life!!!

Give me a call (856) 797-1398.

Thanks,
Karen

I appreciate the email.  I figured something must be wrong for you to miss 
the big day, but I was afraid to call.  The
important thing, obviously, is that you get better.  We'll just have to 
figure out a way to meet up with you in the near
future.  Tell everyone I said hi and keep me informed of your operation and 
recovery.  We'll all miss you very much.

Hugs and Kisses,

Kevin.

P.S.  Tell Tom and John we said hi.

Kevin - Just when you think it's safe to go back in the water!!  Mark Zwick 
at FirstEnergy called earlier.  I had called them last week after we found 
all the deals to make up for what they invoiced us for June's production.  We 
had some volume differences that Mark called to discuss.  On two of the deals 
(281431 and 308806), we have a total volume of 108,000 and 6,007 
respectively.  They invoiced us for 117,180 and 6,512. He claims our volumes 
are in mcf's and that if you apply the conversion factor of 1.085, you come 
up to his numbers.  The question is - who's right?? - Do we input mcf's in 
Sitara and if so, how can we get them adjusted to the dt's they invoiced us 
for?  And if our numbers are already in dt's, why does he think they're not?

The other thing is on deal #303253, we have a volume of 2,952 @ $3.26 where 
they invoiced us for 8,045 @ $3.835.  On this deal, he says our volume is an 
imbalance volume for MAY production (instead of June).  Could there still be 
another deal floating around out there for June's imbalance??  He says he got 
to that number by taking the total volume and subtracting out the other two 
deals (131,737 - 117,180 - 6,512 = 8,045).  He's supposed to be faxing me 
something to show that.  Would it be possible for me to bring that to you 
tomorrow sometime and maybe we can call him together to work all this out?

Sorry to keep harping on this but I'm sitting on a $600,000 receivable that's 
going to start drawing some attention.  Let me know if tomorrow afternoon 
would be convenient for you.

Thanks,
...Chuck

All:

I just wanted to take a minute to bid you farewell.  This will be my last 
week at Enron as I have accepted a job with Kinder Morgan Energy Partners and 
will be starting there next Monday.  I enjoyed working with each of you 
during my time at Enron and hope to keep in touch. I am not sure what my 
email will be at Kinder Morgan but you can always reach me at 
Dax_Sanders@yahoo.com.

Take care and stay in touch,

Dax

Kevin,

 I received a statement from Wisconsin Gas that shows what we received at the 
different points from Wisc. Gas.  My understanding on the deal that we have 
with EES is that we only buy from Wisconsin Gas what EES requests from us.  
On the statement, I can match up what is in our system for all of the points 
except for Willow Run (Michcon).  The Wisc. Gas statement is showing that we 
purchased 13,291 dth on August 16.  I did not see anything come through for 
EES at this location so I asked Julie Boehl in volume management to look into 
it.  She did not see a brokered deal entered for EES at Willow Run.  EES is 
showing purchasing 11,408 from us (they may be incorrect on their volumes) 
and we are not showing any sales that match to this volume.  Could you please 
check into this for me and let me know if this is missing in the system?

Dear Mr. Tagert:

Thanks for a great weekend.  Everything was great.  Hope you had a good
trip home.  Give my regards to Lisa.  Let's talk, seriously this time,
about a weekend for me to come down and visit.

I'm glad you had a great time.  It meant a lot to Lisa and me that you were 
able to spend
the entire weekend with us.  I honestly can't remember the last time I had so 
much fun.  I
hope you felt the same way.  Talk to you soon.

Kevin

Kevin,

I can't remember the last time I was that relaxed!  On Sunday, Muggie asked
me in all seriousness if I had been smoking pot!

I spoke to a guy that said he spends 6-7k every 15-20k miles on ROUTINE
maintenance for his 911!  Unreal.  I have definitely scratched that one of
the list.

Looks like it is divorce court for this kid.  I can't believe it.  I am
actually disgusted by the whole affair.

How is that for an emotional swing in one email!

Have a great weekend!

Frank

TO: Houston Area Employees Participating in Domestic Medical Plan Benefits

FROM: Enron Human Resources


We are pleased to pass along to you the fact that United HealthCare (UHC) and 
Memorial Herman Health Systems (MHHS) reached agreement on a long-term 
contract.   There will be no disruption in terms of accessing network 
services from the hospital system or those providers who were scheduled to be 
terminated.  Employees currently electing UHC will receive a confirming 
letter shortly from UHC.

As mentioned in our earlier memo, it is our understanding that Cigna has also 
been contacted by MHHS and are now in contract negotiations. 

Open Enrollment packages are in the mail and you should consider the above 
facts when making your decision on your medical election.

Congratulations!!

I couldn't be happier for you two.  How's Rena feeling - probably relieved, 
huh?
Thanks for the call with the news.  We were out for the day, that's why 
didn't get back
to you.  I'll try you today.

Kevin

P.S.  Great Name

Kevin,

Sound advice.  I do think I am in the regret stage, though.  I just can't
believe that she could be so clueless as to the state of the overall
relationship.  In the grand scheme of things, we got along extremely well.
I think I just need to break contact with her for a while.

I was laughing about the Campi issue.  After I read your email I vaguely
recalled through the memories of the alcohol induced haze that was your
wedding weekend hearing Pattie refer to Rich as Kampmann.  But, even if I
had remembered it while writing the email, I would have opted for a C vice a
K.  Thankfully, I never had to learn English as a second language.  I would
have sucked!

Though it was nice to dream of a Porsche 911, I, like a good engineer,
returned to my sensibilities to purchased a '99 Saturn SL2.  It is dark blue
with gray leather and only 7400 miles.  I really liked the customer service
aspect and figured I needed every support network I could at a time like
this.  The worst part is that both of my parents have Saturns so it seems
like an old person's car to me.

Speaking of support networks, my mom is in town for 11 days.  She is like a
built in maid service.  I didn't know the house could be this clean!

Take care,

Frank

Kevin,
 As we discussed, here are the changes I feel need to be made to the form 
before Enron North America Corp.  can agree to use it.

1.  Change 1.1 to read as follows:  This Agreement shall be effective upon 
its execution and shall continue in full force and effect through December 
31, 2000.

2.  Change 3.1 to read as follows:  Upon not less than 36 hours advance 
notification by Vector, Seller shall be obligated to sell and deliver to 
Vector, and Vector shall be obligated to purchase and receive from Seller, at 
the time stipulated by Vector in the advance written notification, at a Point 
of Sale, a quantity of gas equal to Seller's PSQ for such Point of Sale, as 
specified in Exhibit A to this Agreement.  The parties agree that time is of 
the essence in this Agreement..

3.  Add 4.2 to read as follows:  4.2  If Vector fails to purchase and receive 
from Seller the quantity of gas required to be purchased and received by it 
under Article 3.1 for any reason other than the occurrence of an event of 
Force Majeure, Vector shall indemnify Seller and shall be liable to pay 
Seller an amount equal to the difference between the price that would have 
been paid to Seller and the Gas Daily low price, set forth in Gas Daily under 
the heading "Daily Price Survey" under the listing applicable to Chicago and 
using the low price in the range of prices published for the day that Vector 
failed to perform multiplied by the volume Vector failed to purchase and 
receive from Seller for such day.

4.  Add the following language at the end of 9.1.  For breach of any 
provision for which an express remedy or measure of damages is herein 
provided, such express remedy or measure of damages shall be the sole and 
exclusive remedy hereunder.  If no remedy or measure of damages is expressly 
herein provided, the obligor's liability shall be limited to direct actual 
damages only, such direct actual damages shall be the sole and exclusive 
remedy hereunder and all other remedies or damages at law or in equity are 
waived.  Unless expressly herein provided, neither party shall be liable for 
consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or indirect damages, lost 
profits or other business interruption damages, in tort, contract, under any 
indemnity provision or otherwise.

5.  Add the following Seller's information in 10.1.
 Enron North America Corp.
 P. O. Box 4428
 Houston, Texas 77210-4428
 Attn:  Documentation and Deal Clearing Desk
 Facsimile No. (713) 646-4816.

The new Purchase Agreement looks nonexistent.  Did you intend to attach 
something for me to review?

They appear to have made the changes that we requested.  Do you want me to 
fill in the name of the Seller and print off 2 originals for signature.  If 
not, please fill in the name and forward to me for initialling before the 
contract is signed by ENA..

Subject: Comments concerning Line Pack Gas Purchase Agreement form provided 
by Vector.

Kevin,
 As we discussed, here are the changes I feel need to be made to the form 
before Enron North America Corp.  can agree to use it.

1.  Change 1.1 to read as follows:  This Agreement shall be effective upon 
its execution and shall continue in full force and effect through December 
31, 2000.

2.  Change 3.1 to read as follows:  Upon not less than 36 hours advance 
notification by Vector, Seller shall be obligated to sell and deliver to 
Vector, and Vector shall be obligated to purchase and receive from Seller, at 
the time stipulated by Vector in the advance written notification, at a Point 
of Sale, a quantity of gas equal to Seller's PSQ for such Point of Sale, as 
specified in Exhibit A to this Agreement.  The parties agree that time is of 
the essence in this Agreement..

3.  Add 4.2 to read as follows:  4.2  If Vector fails to purchase and receive 
from Seller the quantity of gas required to be purchased and received by it 
under Article 3.1 for any reason other than the occurrence of an event of 
Force Majeure, Vector shall indemnify Seller and shall be liable to pay 
Seller an amount equal to the difference between the price that would have 
been paid to Seller and the Gas Daily low price, set forth in Gas Daily under 
the heading "Daily Price Survey" under the listing applicable to Chicago and 
using the low price in the range of prices published for the day that Vector 
failed to perform multiplied by the volume Vector failed to purchase and 
receive from Seller for such day.

4.  Add the following language at the end of 9.1.  For breach of any 
provision for which an express remedy or measure of damages is herein 
provided, such express remedy or measure of damages shall be the sole and 
exclusive remedy hereunder.  If no remedy or measure of damages is expressly 
herein provided, the obligor's liability shall be limited to direct actual 
damages only, such direct actual damages shall be the sole and exclusive 
remedy hereunder and all other remedies or damages at law or in equity are 
waived.  Unless expressly herein provided, neither party shall be liable for 
consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or indirect damages, lost 
profits or other business interruption damages, in tort, contract, under any 
indemnity provision or otherwise.

5.  Add the following Seller's information in 10.1.
 Enron North America Corp.
 P. O. Box 4428
 Houston, Texas 77210-4428
 Attn:  Documentation and Deal Clearing Desk
 Facsimile No. (713) 646-4816.

TEAM CARLTON MAILBOX : ATTENTION MIKE DENZEL

We have received your acceptance and you are confirmed for ClickAtHome Pilot 
2.

You will be notified with an e-mail by November 17th on how and when you can 
access the ordering web site. Ordering is not expected to
begin until December. 

As a pilot participant, you will be testing various aspects of this new 
program such as the program offerings, program communications, product and 
service ordering, vendor services and program support.  At this time, the 
pilot program is not intended to provide access to Enron's network for 
telework purposes.   If you need Enron access for business reasons, please 
continue to maintain your existing computer and connection for this purpose.  
 In advance, we appreciate your co-operation and patience under this pilot 
program.  

Employees will have great options under this program for computers, 
peripherals, and Internet connectivity.   Your personal selections will 
determine your out-of-pocket expense, if any.  By participating the Pilot, 
you are not obligated to order hardware or connectivity, but will be given 
the opportunity to review your options and associated prices.

We know you are interested in more details.  However, one of our primary 
Pilot objectives is to test the communication on our web site.  We would like 
you to review more details about program offerings and related out-of-pocket 
costs, if any, once the pilot web site is available.  After agreeing to the 
Pilot Participants Agreement and reviewing these materials on the web site, 
you may choose to defer ordering until the All Employee roll-out in early 
2001 if you wish.

Please send any questions to the clickathomepilot2@enron.com mailbox.

Thanks.

IN SPORTS TODAY:

After failing to secure a win via a recount of points, the Tennessee Titans
(6-7) are now demanding to replay the final down of their recent 42-41 loss
to the Dallas Cowboys (7-6).  Titan team officials explained that Titan
fans
intended for the final down field goal attempt to be good, and that
replaying the down is therefore justified despite the ruling of officials
that the ball did not pass thru the uprights.  Titan team officials added
that the width of the uprights confused kicker Al DelGreco (17yrs - Auburn)
on the 19 yard attempt and that the uprights should be widened for a replay
of the down.  Cowboys team officials countered that DelGreco had seen the
uprights before the game and had not complained to the officials.  They
added that Cowboy kicker Tim Seder (R - Arkansas) successfully kicked thru
the same uprights during the game from distances of 47, 42 and 36 yards.

Dear Sir or Madam :

 Enron Corp. (=01&Enron=018) believes in conducting its business affairs in=
=20
accordance with the highest ethical standards.  Accordingly, employees of=
=20
Enron and its subsidiaries are required to comply with Enron's Business=20
Ethics Policy which requires an employee to conduct himself/herself in a=20
manner which is not detrimental to the best interests of Enron and which do=
es=20
not bring to the employee financial gain separately derived as a direct=20
consequence of his/her employment with Enron.  Further, Enron's Business=20
Ethics Policy states that no lavish entertainment or gifts are to be given =
or=20
received by Enron employees for special position, price, or privilege.

 Not only is it incumbent upon our employees to follow this policy, but you=
r=20
cooperation in respecting these standards is also critical.  Enron expects=
=20
each of its vendors and contractors to maintain adequate records that=20
document its work relationship with Enron.  Enron's auditing department wil=
l=20
routinely conduct business ethics compliance audits of certain vendors and=
=20
contractors with whom Enron does business.  Your recognition of our ethical=
=20
standards allows Enron employees to work with you via arm's length=20
transactions and avoids potentially embarrassing and unethical situations. =
=20
If you ever become aware of variances from our policy, please advise:

This is a message from Cindy Olson, Executive VP, Human Resource & Community 
Relations.

Please take a few minutes to complete the attached, very brief survey. Your 
input is important in helping determine future efforts in this vital area.

You have been randomly selected to participate in the second of an ongoing 
series of surveys that will be conducted to help us gauge how effectively we 
are leveraging diversity to enhance our organization.

As you know, Enron is engaged in a struggle to recruit and retain the quality 
of talent necessary to allow us to meet and beat our competition.  The 
business case for diversity is inarguable and we must step-up to the 
challenge of recruiting, developing and continually valuing an increasingly 
diverse workforce.  Such an effort requires that we look at diversity in a 
broader context that combines the different thoughts and ideas, life and work 
experiences, as well as skill sets of employees. It is this combination that 
will enable Enron to remain the leading innovator and one of the most admired 
companies in the world.

Thanks in advance for your cooperation and contribution.

Pilot 2 Participants!

Thanks again for participating in ClickAtHome's Pilot study.  We are very 
anxious to get started and are so excited to bring this incredible benefit to 
you!  We promised we would follow up this week, so here we are...  

Based on feedback we have received from Pilot 1, we are taking additional 
time to further integrate with our vendor websites and are expanding the 
vendor offerings to bring broadband coverage to more employees.  We 
anticipate ordering to begin in late December.  Please feel free to email us 
at clickathomepilot2@enron.com if you have any questions.  

Thanks again,
The ClickAtHome Project Team!

Here is the draft procedures that I sent you back in September.  It does not 
incorporate the changes that you sent
us a few days latter.  I will forward a copy of that memo also.  We are 
looking forward to getting with you to discuss the 
procedures and timing.

Subject: Procedures for Incremental Empire Gas for On-Peak Day Ahead Market

Marty suggested that I get these discussions kicked off on your side while he 
was
out-of-town today.  Basically, I started off with your proposed procedures 
and made
a few changes that Enron needs to make sure that right amount of gas shows up 
at the
correct time.

Also, we are suggesting a confirmation form be sent back and forth between 
Enron and
Sithe every day.  This will help document all the small little details and 
costs so that we
both drop anything through the cracks.  I am suggesting that we e-mail this 
confirm form
to the right folks in both our companies, so that no one is left out of the 
loop.

You will also notice our attempt to make sure that everyone has a clear 
understanding
of exactly what is included in the numbers that are reported to Enron's 
traders.  The timing
of your calls will be when everyone is very busy in our trading group.  There 
will not be much
time to have long conversations, but it is very important that everyone have 
the same
understanding what the numbers mean.

Please take a look at this on your side and see if there are some other 
things that need to
be included.

Thanks,

Ruth

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Mark Frevert and Mark Haedicke

Having seen the trouble with the votes in Florida, I think this new more
technical ballot will help in the next election or if a revote is ordered.

Dave,

It was great getting a chance to finanlly meet the other night.  Hope you 
enjoyed dinner.

Since then, I've been thinking abt some of our conversation re: the PBR.  I 
have a quick
question - why wouldn't you under withdraw in Feb and over withdraw in Mar if 
Mar is currently
higher than Feb.  You could lock this in by buying Mar forward.  Also,  what 
happens if you
withdraw in Mar and the Summer peaks higher than what you withdrew at?  How 
is this accounted
for?

I'll talk to you after you get back from Houston.

Kevin

Subject: I'll keep taking punches until their will grows  tired.

In 1974 the S&P 500 dropped 27% AFTER the first  rate cut by the fed.? In 
1981 it dropped 15% AFTER the first rate cut by  the fed.? With a S&P 500 
still trading at twice it's growth rate, 20 vs  10, a NASDAQ still trading at 
70 times earings, and a bullish advisor sentiment  still at 55%, the backdrop 
for a sharp rally isn't very good.? In a slowing  earnings enviroment I 
believe investors should focus on two sectors.? The  first are companies like 
Tootsie Roll Industries that manage to grow earnings  like clockwork.? 
Secondly, telecom/tech companies that are trading at their  growth rate and 
there is some assurrance that their customers are in a position  to keep 
ordering and paying for products.? For Tootsie Roll Industries it  is easy 
since the end user is the consumer and this products' consumption is  fairly 
recession proof.?? Efficient Networks' customers are SBC  Communications and 
others who then install their products to offer their  customer price savings 
that justify their capital investment. As long as SBC's  is financially 
strong and their ROI warrants the investment, the Efficient's of  the world 
appear to be interesting ideas.?  


? There will be layoffs not just in the DOT com world, probably everybody  at 
AMAZON, but also certain industries like the Financials and Auto's.?  This 
should remove once and for all any last Greenspan' fears of a wage led  
inflationary revival.? His comments yesterday were an admittance that this  
economy is softer than 14 feet of fresh powder in Montana.? Housing prices  
and financial assets were simply too inflated in general.? That doesn't  mean 
there aren't some good real estate markets and it doesn't mean there aren't  
any fair priced companies.

Nelson,
As you know, Grand Cheniere was under maintenance in October and we had to 
shut in Johson Bayou.   Francis wants us to reallocate (trespass gas) that 
they continued to flow onto ANR in the amout of  54,536mm to us  at an agreed 
upon price of $5.20.   ANR has agreed to do this next week.  Since you are 
out today Francis asked us to make sure you called him about this as well as 
another issue.

ched=20
and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which sour=
ce=20
would best meet our current and future needs in terms of quality, performan=

and cost containment objectives.  The Business Unit Implementation Project=

We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001.=

will not affect their position. In an effort to preserve relationships, all=
=20
current staffing vendors will be invited to participate in this enhanced=20
program.  CORESTAFF shares our commitment to minimize any disruptions in=20
service during this transition.=20
=20
We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha,=20
Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001.  T=
he=20
scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these tw=
o=20
phases have been completed.

Realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today, we=
=20
selected CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group based on their exceptional=
=20
management team, commitment to quality service, and creative solutions to o=
ur=20
staffing needs.  The relationship promises to offer Enron a cost effective=

Managed Services program will be announced soon and meetings will be=20

Dear Amazon Customer,

As someone who has purchased books about World War II and the men
and women who fought it, you might like to know about two recent
releases: "Our Finest Hour: The Triumphant Spirit of America's
World War II Generation" and Andy Rooney's "My War." These two
books, along with three related history titles, are now available
at 40% off. You can order your copies by following the links below:

"Our Finest Hour"
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1883013984/
"Life" magazine boasted an uncommonly talented roster of writers
and photographers during World War II. "Our Finest Hour" features
the images and reports that brought home to American readers the
horrors of that distant war, and also documents the efforts on the
home front. This selection of photographs and extended captions
from the pages of "Life" and other contemporary publications
gathers images that have become part of American iconography.

Andy Rooney's "My War"
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1586480103/
Andy Rooney's "My War," a fine and wholeheartedly irreverent memoir,
recounts his experiences as a correspondent for "Stars and Stripes,"
where he saw combat up-close while honing his craft alongside such
fellow chroniclers as Ernie Pyle and Bill Mauldin.

And, save 40% on these popular World War II-related titles:

"Flags of Our Fathers"

the election




Looks like Maury and I will be moving back to Texas soon, based on the
following proposal....

Solution to the Election:

#1:  Al Gore becomes President of the United States (all 49
states).

#2:  George W. Bush becomes the President of The Republic of Texas.

Gore shouldn't mind as he said we were the worst state in the union
during the campaign.

So what does Texas have to survive as a Republic?:

NASA in Houston, Texas (we will control the space industry).

We refine over 85% of the gasoline in the United States (that is why
Houston has problems with the air quality).

Defense Industry (we have over 65% of it).  The term "Don't mess
with Texas," will take on new meaning.

Oil - we can supply all the oil the Republic of Texas will need for
the next 300 years.

Natural Gas-Again we have all we need (too bad about those northern
states). Al Gore will figure a way to keep Tipper and you warm....

Computer Industry-we currently lead the nation in producing computer
chips.
A small place named Texas Industries, Dell Computer, EDS, etc., etc.

Health Centers-We have the largest research centers for Cancer
research, the best burn centers, and other large health planning centers.


We have enough colleges to keep us going:  UT, Texas A&M, Rice,
University of Houston, SMU, Baylor, UNT, Texas Women's University, etc.

We have a ready supply of workers (just open the border when we need
some more) and our friends across the border will pour in by the
thousands.

We have control of the paper industry, plastics, insurance, etc.

This just names a few of the items that will keep the Republic of
Texas afloat.

Now to the rest of the United States under President Gore:

Since you won't have the refineries to get gas for your cars, only
President Gore will be able to drive around in his SUV which gets him
about 9  miles per gallon.  The rest of the United States will have to
walk or ride bikes.

You won't have any TV as the space center in Houston will cut off
your communications.

You won't have any natural gas to heat your homes but since Al's
promised global warming, I'm sure you won't get cold!

You won't need our computer chips since you won't have electricity
to power the computers.

So don't worry about us down here in Texas.  We will be OK.

David J. Robinson, D. Min.

Houston Graduate School of Theology

Attached please find a copy of volumes delivered to  Columbia Energy Services 
for March 1 thru March 9, 2000.  I downloaded this directly from Michcon's 
system  and the actual volumes Columbia received at each meter point is in 
the ADJ NOM VOLUME column.  It is broken out in what was delivered in dth and 
what was delivered in mcf.    I have also added a column to show the 
difference between what was delivered in dth vs mcf.   

We had numerous problems with nominations on Michcon's system for the dates 
of 3/2 thru 3/7, however Tom Butzon with Michcon worked very hard to make 
sure that all of our markets were kept whole.   After reviewing deliveries to 
CES per Michcon's system this is the breakout per day:

   Per CES Request  Per Michcon  Difference
3/1/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/2/00   11,417    11,240   (177)
3/3/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/4/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/5/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/6/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/7/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/8/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/9/00   11,450    11,450   0


I spoke with Tom this afternoon regarding the cut on 3/2/00 and he cannot go 
back and reallocate that point.    Regarding the increase for 3/8/00 it is 
imperative that Donna calls us to let us know that she sent an email due to 
the fact that we do not always have time to check email in time to get the 
gas put in the position for the next day.  Also in the event that someone is 
out and that person cannot check their email, a simple telephone call to the 
scheduler would help tremendously.  

Reqarding Doug's letter dated 3/7/00 regarding insufficient volumes at 
acceptable points for the Michcon Select Program, it is my understanding that 
a volume of 7,300 mcf is the requirement CES has to the Select Program.  On 
the attached spreadsheet I have broken out the points Enron delivered gas to 
CES on the acceptable points and we have met those requirements every day 
with the exception of 3/8 and 3/9 where Enron shorted CES volumes at required 
Map #'s by 272 mcf.  This was due to late changes we received by our 
suppliers.   If CES did incur penalties on 3/1 thru 3/7 then CES needs to 
look at how they are allocating each point since certain points are to be 
delivered to the Select Program first.   When CES receives all their points 
for the day they should first allocate the SELECT points to their SELECT 
customers, the remaining points  can then be divided up between their other 
non specific customers.   I apologize for the confusion but I believe we have 
made a valiant effort to keep CES whole at the proper points as best we 
could.  



Should you have any questions, please call me at 713-853-9138.

Kevin,

Great to hear from you!  I was beginning to think you had dropped off the
face of the earth.

I am getting on the boat in about 4 hours - midnight.  Actually, it's not
too bad that way as I go right to sleep when I get on.  I fly at night on
Saturday so I can sleep in.  Fortunately, I will only be on the boat for 18
days as we are conducting the exercise in Okinawa vice another country.
Hopefully, the situation in Taiwan won't deteoriate between now and when I
get off.

Great news about the house!  Send us some digital photos if you have them.
I think it is better to buy a house that needs some work as you are able to
get more home for the cash.  Also, it is easier to turn a profit if you
sell.  Not to mention having some projects in work is always a good hobby.

Marie and I came really close to making an offer on a beach house in Navarre
beach.  Fortunately, reason got the best of us and we are waiting until we
get back before we make such a monumental decision.  There are just too many
factors involved to make the decision from some digital photos.  So, are you
planning on staying in Houston for a while?

A smaller wedding sounds like a good plan.  To me, having a few close
friends present is always better than a bunch of strap hangers.  However,
most chicks would probably disagree.  Marie seems to have had no regrets
with our ultra small wedding.  Just let me know what you need me to do to
help pull it off.

If all goes well, we will start heading home in mid-June and settle in
around early August.  I will also be home for Erin's wedding in May.  We
will also be doing some house hunting in Pensacola at that time.  We will be
in the states from the 20th of May through the 9th of June.  Let me know if
you are available on the first or last weekend and we will stop in Houston
on the way in or out for a day or two.  The tickets we buy allow us four
stops anywhere in the US.

The only wild card in all of this is Test Pilot School.  I applied to the
board that meets in May.  If I get selected, I would go to Maryland instead
of Florida and it wouldn't be until mid-November.  If that happens, and I
actually hope it doesn't, we would either stay here for a few more months or
go to Md. early.  Either way, I will be at your wedding.

Glad to hear from you,

Frank

My address on the boat will be

conwayfp@belleau-wood.usmc.mil

Subject: Is it safe?

Lower interest rates doesn't mean you can buy  companies with broken and 
unproven businessplans, Amazon.? It also doesn't  mean u buy the Wintel 
monopoly because the pc revolution has been over for a  couple of years.? I'm 
working on a liquid crystal display company called  Applied Films because I 
think screens are future, not laptops, not pc's or  hardware companies in 
general.? Lower rates will not save Xerox.? What  lower rates does mean is 
that if a company is hitting on all cylinders the  market may give it a 40 
price to earnings ratio instead of a 30.? It may  get the short sellers off 
our back on names like Nextlink, now called XO  communications whose business 
plan works but who needs lenders to open up their  wallets again and this 
time only to real companies, sorry Webvan, Priceline,  Pets.com, and of 
course Amazon.? If these lenders weren't so burned with  this paper they 
might still be lending to the internet infrastructure names like  XO and 
Teligent.? The trillion dollar question is will multiple  appreciation 
compensate enough for the earnings slowdown in the next quarter or  two.? For 
the autos I think not.? Remember my comments two months ago  about Auto 
layoffs around the corner.? Today GM announced Dec. sales down  almost 20%.
??? This is a critical time in the  market for investors.? If we can find 
stocks who won't be affected by an  earnings slowdown, McDonalds, then we 
should start to get some multiple  appreciation and therefore higher stock 
prices.? If Oracle grows at 40%  instead of 50% but the market starts paying 
higher multiples for strong  companies we could also see Oracle move higher.? 
And lastly for telecom  names that do have a sound strategy and management 
team,access to capital should  appear somewhere down this new horizon.
??? My suggestions are as follows:  My largest new position is a research 
fund by Goldman Sachs that closes to new  investors at the end of Jan.? 
Typically technology and financial stocks  lead the market when the FED 
begins easing like they did today.? This fund  is 25% in tech and 25% in 
financials with other names in the fund including  Merck, Philip Morris,Tyco 
and Enron.? The Goldman list was positive last  year even with such heavy 
tech exposure and a Nasdaq? market that was down  almost 40%. I feel it's a 
nice way to participate in a market that has been hit  hard.? The remaining 
positions may not be for everyone but here are some  suggestions
?
??? Libery Media Group
??? McDonalds
??? Oracle
??? Philip Morris
??? Echostar???  
??? XO Communications
??? Omnicom
??? JDS Uniphase
???? 
Aggressive Ideas:
??? BEA systems
??? Redback Networks
??? Efficient Networks
??? Applied Micro  Circuits
??? Sibel Systems
??? Openwave  Communications
??? Comverse Technology
??? Avanex
?
Tax bounce idea:
??? Northeast  Optics

If you could only own one stock what would it be?  For me it would be EOG

With the extension of the PRC to all organizations, questions have arisen=
=20
about the results of this process. This memo provides some details about th=
e=20
PRC process.

First some context:  The key to Enron=01,s success is the increasing qualit=
y and=20
dedication of our talent.  As we continue to attract and retain the very be=
st=20
people, we all have continued to raise the performance bar throughout the=
=20
organization.  At the core of our system are the following principles:

? Hire the best people.
? Provide challenging opportunities.
? Pay well =01( and pay for performance (with bonuses based on merit, not=
=20
entitlement).
? Evaluate performance through a rigorous review process.
? Provide clear feedback and direction to employees.

The PRC is a critical component of our performance management system.  The=
=20
PRC is built on this foundation:

? 360 degree performance feedback.
? Review by a broad group, not just the supervisor.
? A relative ranking of performance across Enron to determine promotions an=
d=20
to allocate bonus money.


In addition to understanding this broad philosophy, we all need to understa=
nd=20
the following details:

? Relative ranking.  Enron uses the descriptors =01&superior=018, =01&excel=
lent=018,=20
=01&strong=018, "satisfactory", =01&needs improvement=018, and =01&issues=
=018 to group all=20
employees.  This year, =01&relative to his/her peers=018 precedes each of t=
hese=20
descriptors. This qualifier confirms what we have done and will continue to=
=20
do in practice; that is, evaluate individual performers against their peers=
. =20
It is possible, therefore, for someone to perform at the same or higher lev=
el=20
compared to prior periods, yet receive a lower rating for the current perio=
d=20
if other employees=01, performance raised the bar.
? Teamwork.  A relative ranking may invite the view that for one employee t=
o=20
gain, others must suffer.  However, feedback is explicitly solicited on=20
teamwork when evaluating each individual=01,s performance.  Anyone who atte=
mpts=20
to gain by withholding information or refusing to collaborate with others i=
n=20
the organization will suffer in a relative ranking on this key performance=
=20
criterion.
? Preferred distribution. In large part, the quality of our workforce has=
=20
been driven by our willingness to make tough decisions. We have consistentl=
y=20
captured business opportunities and overcome obstacles because we have made=
=20
the choices that had to be made in order to constantly improve our employee=
=20
talent base. The preferred distribution (5% superior, 30% excellent, 30%=20
strong, 20% satisfactory, and 15% needs improvement or issues) forces PRC=
=20
committee members to identify those who must improve in order to remain at=
=20
Enron as well as to single out top talent for special recognition. There is=
=20
some flexibility in the system, but every organization must ultimately face=
=20
this difficult question: have we achieved the highest level of performance =
or=20
are there still improvements that must be made? Few, if any, organizations=
=20
adhere exactly to the preferred distribution. Rather, they exercise informe=
d=20
discretion in the individual categories and meet a distribution that reflec=
ts=20
their groups=01, overall effectiveness and need for improvement.
? Communicating Ratings. Everyone rated =01&satisfactory=018 or below shoul=
d know=20
his/her rating. Each organization has determined for itself whether to=20
communicate ratings of =01&strong=018 and above.  In all cases, employees w=
ill=20
receive feedback about their performance against expectations, areas of=20
success, and areas that need improvement.

We hope this answers most of your questions about the PRC process.  We woul=
d=20
like your feedback and ideas on how to improve the PRC process going=20
forward.  Therefore, we will be conducting an eSpeak in the near future, an=
d=20
there will be other methods we will create to let us know what you think.  =
In=20
the meantime, please feel free to consult with your HR Generalist if you ha=
ve=20
any immediate questions, comments, or concerns.

Bri,

What's the deal with this Gray Davis guy?  What's your opinion on him?  He's
pretty much out to lunch on this whole energy crisis thing.  I was wondering 
how
the citizens of California viewed him.  

Hope everything is going well with Kim, Kendall and yourself.  Talk to you 
soon.
Send an updated picture if you have one.

Duude,
What's happening? Finally getting around to getting
you my new email and tele #. I left Pru back in
mid-December and have been running non-stop with the
new job. It is a world of difference going from Corp
America to a start-up, but its been fun.

Been doing some traveling and spending a lot of time
trying to get new customers and servicing the ones we
sign up.

So how was N.O.? I'm sure that the three of you didn't
do any drinking or got into any trouble.

Tell the lovely Mrs. Ruscitti that we say hello. Don't
forget, let me know the next time you are in Jersey
and if you have time we should hook up.

I had bookmarked Mr. Conway's email on my computer at
Pru and forgot to take it with me, can you send it to
me. Thanks and talk to you soon,

Hey Kev,

Good to hear from you.  Hope all is well.  Well we out here in the Golden 
State
could certainly use some help from you and the boys at 
Enron...................
Gray Davis is a little mouse!  That about describes most peoples opininion of
him.  The power and natural gas situation out here is a mess!  The gas 
situation
is much worse for us at this point here in Long Beach.  We haven't seen any
power outages or any significant increase in our bill either.  The gas front 
is
an entirely different matter!  I just paid a $300 bill for the month of Dec.  
I
paid $100 for the same month in 1999.  The usage (therms) was the
same............ figure that one out?!?!  At that level I might as well be
paying for heating oil in Maine.  Most people I talk to have scene their gas
bill go up 2 or 3 fold.

Anyway, things could be a whole lot worse I guess.  Luke just had his 1st
birthday party this past weekend.  It was quite the scene.  I think his next
party will be when he is 18.  Say hello to Lisa for us.

TJ

Jen,

Great to hear from you.  Early congrats on your graduation.  Everything has 
been
going well down in the Lone Star State.  I got married in September down the 
Jersey
shore and everything has been going well.  We bought a house back in May.  It 
needs
an incredible amount of work.  We own the ugliest house on the block, by far.

How are things in Indiana?  Are you and Paul still together?  How is he 
doing?  When
is the last time you were back in Jersey?  We went back over Christmas but 
only for
a couple days.  I think next year we'll go back during New Year's instead of 
Christmas.
If you ever get near Texas or pass through Houston, please give us a call.  
You both
are always welcome to stay at our house.  My phone # is (713) 880-4157.  My 
work
# is (713) 853-6320.  Hope to hear from you soon.

Kevin

Hi all,

I am on the move again.  In case anyone has travel plans to the NE or TX,
I'll will be in either NJ or DC from the 4th-24th of March and in Corpus
Christi from the 24th of March through early May.  I'll settle in at Pax
River (SE MD) sometime in late May.  This email account should remain active
throughout or you can reach me at conway77@hotmail.com or on my cell at
850.939.8989.

Hope all is well,

Frank

That state will never be the same.  My prediction is that the state will be
bankrupt within the next 2 years unless the Federal Gov't bails it out.  I 
hope
Lowery has held off on buying his house.

Talk to you this weekend.  I blew off the Montana trip so I'll be home.

Kev-it certainly sounds like you have alot on your hands with the house, but
i'm sure it will all work out.  Maybe you can call rabbit to come and do some
renovation work.  after all, he did spend his entire sophomore year building
the brothers bar!!  Or maybe give marro a call-he was the house manager and
pretty good with his hands.  Or better yet, give morgante a ring.  he won't
show up, but he'll take your wife out for a date.  By the way,
congratulations on getting married!!  Next time you come to NJ I'll give you
your present (it's on ice, don't worry)
    Yes I am still dating beth.  It's a little tough with the distance (as
i'm sure you can understand), but we do the best we can and when we see each
other it's always great.  We actually spent new year's down in mexico.
Matter of fact i picked up the rest of my pictures the other day and quickly
proceeded to become depressed at the fact that i am here and not there.
Needless to say we had a great time.  You know, we are figuring on taking a
trip sometime in the spring, maybe vegas.  it would be unbelievable if you
and lisa could meet us.  Or maybe we can even visit you guys.  let me know.
    I saw sweets new office recently.  He and i had lunch.  I'll tell you
something, he is such a great guy.  everytime i call him for anything, no
matter how long it's been since i've talked to him, he always acts like i
just spoke with him.  I have to fax you the letter he sent to me last year.
It was fucking hilarious.  Anyway, the office is great and i met one of his
new partners.  i'm sure they will do excellent there.
    I hope work is going well.  I'm keeping my eye on enron.  they are always
in the NY Times with some sort of inventive stuff that they're doing.  It
looks like a pretty cool company.  I also have a mutual fund that invests
heavily in the company.
    My work has been extremely hectic, but things couldn't be better.  My
partner pete and i merged our office with another guy on January 1 and now we
are a 3 partner firm.  We bought a building in Hawthorne and we close on
April 1.  I'm looking forward to getting into the building soon.  We have to
wait though for some renovations to be done.  But it should be pretty
exciting.  It's  a victorian house and it's a real nice setup.
    The only other person i have seen recently is coun.  He and Chris met
Beth and i for lunch a couple of weeks ago at the short hills mall.
Oh-before i forget, my number at work is (973) 569-0888.  Give me a call
soon, and give me your work number as well.
    Oh one last thing, give me moller's e-mail address if you have it.  And
something else, let me know next time you guys are road tripping to louisiana
or wherever else.  i am definitely in.
    Well take care, definitely stay in touch and by all means give the former
Ms. taggart my best.  It was great hearing from you.

-Ricigs

Hey Slick.  Got your Christmas card.  Thank you.  I was Scrooge-like

BL,

Have you experienced any blackouts yet?  I think you'll see a lot this summer.
What does everyone think about the situation?  Do they think it's a threat or 
not?  I think
the state is in for a horrific summer - I hope it doesn't turn out that way, 
but it'll be incredibly
difficult to avoid.

Hope everything's going well with work and with the family.  When's the next 
time you'll
be in Dallas?  Let me know.

good points and yes the Dow just needs one more week like this to trade
under 9000 so 8000 is not a stretch.   Markets typically predict a recession
long before it arrives.  In the second q of this year you will see some sort
of headline that says Recession hits US.  I would buy that day.  As for
california, the worlds 6th largest economy,  energy is obviously your space
but I think that the calpines, capstones, and others are options such as the
contract they received last month.  Hope all is well.  Sweets party was fun.
It was only missing you and TJ. j

Stamos, 

Glad everyone had a good time at Sweets'.  I hope he had a blast.

In terms of your email reply,
you can have Calpine.  How are they going to make money long term if price 
caps are instituted?  This obviously would be the stupidest policy.  In 
addition
their exposure to the CA crisis must be pretty significant - when and how are 
they
going to get paid?  I wouldn't want to bank on the energy market in the most 
regulated state in the country.  Plus, if the state backs energy purchases, 
it's 
going to get to the point where who wants to own CA credit??  PG&E and Edison
International are doomed, as they should be.  The state of CA is going to go
down the tubes unless they find some good leadership.  Unfortunately, noone
out there seems to have the least clue on how to solve the problem.  The 
politicians
are a complete joke.  It is incredibly disheartening to witness the absolute 
stupidity
of the CA politicians in addressing this issue.  They seem to be much more 
focused 
on finger pointing than coming up with a viable solution.  I honestly think 
they are incable
of solving the problem.

you obviously know the energy market better than most.  My guy at goldman,
Jonathan Raleigh, has been on calpine for 4 years and has killed it, so i'm
just following his lead. as for the futile leadership in ca, i agree.
wouldn't it be nice for you, me , tj, and sweets to run a company or a
state. j

Kevin,

How's things?  Been a while since we talked.  Hope your jobs are going well
and your wedding plans are proceeding smoothly.

Did you get my e-mail about running into Mary Eyre in the gym in San Mateo?
Spooky.  I've seen her a couple more times but I haven't spoken to her; I
get in the "properly pumped" zone.  Turns out there are a lot of classmates
on the peninsula - David Park, Frank Knifsend, Mary, and James Regan come to
mind immediately.

No real news here.  We haven't broken anything in the house in a while, so
either we're getting luckier or we're due.  Both jobs are very busy right
now so the weekends are for recuperating.  This weekend, of course, will be
for watching basketball.

Hi to Lisa - let us know how you're doing.

Regards,

Tim Sarhatt

Kevin,

Siobhan let me know that she reached you last week.  Thanks for taking the
time to forward my credentials within Enron to their Wind operation.  I have
a resume and a general cover letter zipped to this email.

Just to let you know in case you speak with someone at Enron Wind, I sent a
"cold" resume about two weeks back for an opening in project sales/marketing
(Job codes 111363/111364).  They have many interesting projects on the table
and I am eager to talk with their recruiter about global openings.

Let me know if there is anything I must do to follow up or provide additional
information.  Thanks again for your help.

David

Matt or Frank,

Please provide a sigma factor for the following product type requested by 
Kevin Ruscitti:

US Gas Phy Fwd Secondary Firm

A US gas transaction with Enron North America Corp., under which Seller shall 
sell and Buyer shall purchase a quantity of natural gas equal to the Daily 
Contract Quantity at the Contract Price on a Secondary Firm basis.  The 
Contract Price shall be as submitted by Counterparty via the Website.  The 
Period of Delivery shall be from the Effective Date through the Termination 
Date.
The term of the Transaction shall be from the Effective Date to the 
Termination Date. The Effective Date is 01 May 2001. The Termination Date is 
31 May 2001.
The Transaction is for delivery at an ANR Pipeline Company ML7 interconnect.  
The Purchaser will determine at what ML7 interconnect to take delivery.  The 
volumes Delivered by the Seller are subject to reductions due to operational 
constraints on the ANR Pipeline system. In the event that scheduled volumes 
are reduced due to pipeline operational constraints, Buyer will designate an 
alternate ML7 delivery location until an unconstrained point is designated.  
In the event that the Buyer cannot take receipt at an alternative ML7 point, 
the Buyer must arrange for the gas to be delivered off-system, stored or

spaces at the new garage would please return your Met and Allen Center 
parking cards ASAP,so that we can back fill your spaces with others on the 
waiting list.  The Allen Center and Met cards will be deactivated 
immediately. Please contact Parking and Transportation if you have any 
questions.  You may hand your old card to the security guard at the garage 
exit through the end of this week.

Thank you very much for your cooperation.

here the additional 150 dth/day into Piedmont off Transco for 3/21-3/31.
However, we are still waiting on a price quote from Chris for that volume.  If
we end up getting that gas elsewhere, I will send you a revised spreadsheet 
w/o
the additional 150dth/day into Piedmont.

Chris--The attached file contains the daily changes for 3/27 and 3/28 in the
volumes of gas that we need by market area.  The daily changes are relative to
what we requested on a First-of-the month basis, which values appear in Col.
DD.   You can just open this file and print it out to see the magnitude of the
changes by market area or zone.  We'll be calling regarding pricing.

Chris--Attached is the spreadsheet that we spoke of earlier today.  I have 
made
the correction to TCO Op 2, Mkt Area 20 into NYSEG (i.e. +854 dth/day).   I
will make the necessary changes to the AGL volumes over the next few minutes.
As we discussed, we'll need to resolve the question about Central Hudson off
Iroquois (we may not need any volumes there since Duke is the supplier), and 
as
I said, we'll be discussing our needs into southern Connecticut on a firm 
basis
with other suppliers.   I am also attaching the spreadsheet with the storage
injections for assigned storage.   I believe that we need to negotiate the
price for all of the  April storage injections.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for
and          .    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled with today's 
date
contains the volumes that we need at each of the delivery points indicated.
The schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at 
a
specific point.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

The attached file is an update to the file of the same name that I sent 
earlier
this morning.   The only change is a reduction in daily Dth off Transco Z5 
into
Piedmont from 950/day to 50/day for 3/29 thru the end of March.

In what appears to be a rather unoriginal move these days, I've resigned from 
Mother Enron in favor of an early stage .com opportunity.  My last day will 
be this Friday, March 31st.

I'm not a fan of long goodbyes, so let me just say 'thank you' to each of 
you, for the part you played in making my two and a half years at Enron both 
memorable and rewarding.  My new employer (HomeWrite.com) is Houston-based, 
so with the glaring exception of Iaia, I hope to see each of you in the not 
so distant future. 

All my best,

Scott

p.s. Beginning Monday, April 3rd, I can be reached at:

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for
and          .    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled with today's 
date
contains the volumes that we need at each of the delivery points indicated.
The schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at 
a
specific point.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

volumes that we need at each of the delivery points indicated.   The 
schedulers
will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at a specific
point.    The AGL volumes are not current and should be ignored.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

Friends,

Siddhartha, Nidhesh, and I are moving back home to Calcutta, India in April, 
2000.

Attached are our contact details.  I would have loved to contact each one of 
you directly but this has happened in a hurry and we have to pack, wrap up 
and leave Houston by April 20.  So please call to catch up and maybe plan a 
visit to Calcutta!

My work email and voicemail will remain active as I will be on a leave of 
absence from Azurix.  I will check them periodically.  Today is my last day 
at work. 

I hope that you will make to the happy hour that Gaby is planning next week. 
I would love to see you.

Regards,

-sheetal

Hi Kev,

I sent this e-mail to your original Enron address and got an automated
response saying that it had changed.  Here it is again just in case you
didn't get it.  Drop me a line when you can.

Thanks,

Kelly,

I spoke with my friend and he mentioned that Michael was already talking to 2 
firms and he
didn't want to recommend a third at this time.  I told him that if anything 
changes, let me know.
It was worth a try anyway.  I'll talk to you soon.  

Kevin

indicated.   The schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas
is needed at a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be
ignored until further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is
archived on P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to
save a duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily citygate volume relative to a prior value.  For the 
current
gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the 
previous
day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 
3/28,
then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

The sheet labelled storage is for tracking our TCO storage injections (paper
injections).

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  4/10/00  and  
the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'TCO Storage':  Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its (paper) storage
injection for the month.    Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet
some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the
"Daily Change' worksheet.

Attached is an updated version of the daily file that I sent earlier this

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for    and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'TCO Storage':  Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its (paper) storage
injection for the month.    Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet
some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the
"Daily Change' worksheet.     Note:  This sheet has been omitted from the
attached file for 04/11/00 pending resolution of issues related to TCO storage
with Chris Germany.

The attached file is an updated version of the one that I sent a few minutes
ago of the same name.   The changes are minor and are as follows:

*In the Daily Chg worksheet, the intraday change on BGE of +303 is all on
Choice+DCQ.  The original had 40 dth of the increase on Choice +DCQ and the
remaining 263 on EU 164, which was not correct.  No changes were made to the
volumes in the Total Reqs. worksheet which were correct in the original
version.

Sorry for any inconvenience.

negotiated.
'TCO Storage':  Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its (paper) storage
injection for the month.    Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet
some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the
"Daily Change' worksheet.   Omitted pending resolution of TCO storage issues.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  4/17 and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'TCO Storage':  Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its (paper) storage
injection for the month.    Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet
some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the
"Daily Change' worksheet.    Note: This worksheet not provided due to issues
related to TCO storage.

Attached please find the nipsco changes for the 20th.  Please note that there 
is a change on the ANR leg from 200 @ ANR/Ft Wayne to 141 @ ANR/Ft Wayne and 
59 @ ANR/Michigan City.   This will balance your Pool B and make you take the 
withdrawal on Pool A.   Otherwise you would be injecting on Pool B and 
withdrawing on Pool A.  


Total Demand:    Nominated  Difference

Pool A  936   859   (77)     
Pool  B  141   141       0

Total  1,077   1,000   (77)

Also, please note that all changes for 4/21 thru 4/24 are due to be nominated 
on 4/20/00 since Nipsco is closed for the holiday on Friday so if you are 
increasing or decreasing volumes over the weekend I need to have those 
numbers no later than 9:30 tomorrow morning.


Thanks,


Cora

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  4/20  and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are two  worksheets labelled as follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.

Kev,

Don't know if this found you or not but I got your new EMail address sent back
to me.  We also just received the gift from you and Lisa.  Thanks a bunch.
Luke will definitely cuddle up in the warmth after his baths.  Say hello to
Lisa.  You know Rena will have the formal Thank You off in the mail soon.  
Hope
to see you guys soon.  By the way, do you have Bill Ricigliano's phone # by
chance.  Send it to me if you do.

T.J.

Thanks for the picture.  I'm glad you guys like the gift.  Luke looks just 
like Rena, huh?

As far as Ricigs goes, I don't have his phone # or address.  I think Moller 
does though.
Let me know  if you need his #.  Take care and tell Rena and Luke we said hi.

TJ,

Thanks for the congratulatory message you left on our voicemail - it made us 
feel great.
We actually didn't go on a honeymoon - we will take one sometime next year.  
We've just
been swamped with the house we recently bought.  We bought an old small 
bungalow
in the city.  What a money pit.  Hope everything is going great.  Tell 
everyone we said
hi.

Thanks again,

Kevin

Alliance presented this to PGL when they were here on Tuesday (its the firm 
shippers primary deliver points).As an interesting note PGL interconnect will 
allow 600, but their system can't handle it.  We're working with our Canadian 
office to "buy" some of this alliance gas for PGL.  What we are looking at is 
reducing your baseload sale and part of their DIQ and replacing it with 
alliance gas.  We'll talk about it later.

Barbara,

I met with some people from Alliance Pipeline yesterday to discuss
nominations and confirmations.  Attached is a piece of information that
might be of interest to the daily group.  Could you route to the rest of the
group?

Thanks.

Kevin Ruscetti would like to trade Physical Index transactions for delivery 
to ANR ML7 based on the above referenced Index. He tells me that it is widely 
known that delivery at ANR ML7 is secondary firm, and states that if allowed 
to transact on this the language would need to state that the parties would 
employ their 'best efforts' to deliver.

Joe - can you try and find me some Confirm language for this.

Comments, please.

Subject: EPNG Blanco NonBondad

David,

Could you take a few minutes to review the attached new location EPNG 
NonBondad.  Tori Kuykendall from the west desk has told us she wants the same 
language that SoCal Topock has due to the fact that the EPNG NonBondad 
section of the pipeline has a history of breaking down and being interrupted 
all the time.  

Thank you,

Melba
58986

Existing:
EPNG SoCal Topock
The transaction is for delivery at the Southern California Gas Company -  
Topock interconnect with El Paso Natural Gas.  The volumes scheduled to be 
delivered are subject to reductions due to normal operational constraints on 
both El Paso Natural Gas and Southern California Gas Company pipelines based 
upon historical operating conditions.  The reductions caused by these 
constraints are excused nonperformance and are not considered a failure to 
receive or deliver firm gas.

New:
EPNG Blanco NonBondad
The transaction is for delivery at El Paso San Juan Blanco non-Bondad.  The 
volumes scheduled to be delivered are subject to reductions due to normal 
operational constraints on El Paso Natural Gas Pipelines based upon 
historical operating conditions.  The reductions caused by these constraints 
are excused nonperformance and are not considered a failure to receive or 
deliver firm gas.

Kevin,

I recently saw that a Team Thadeus (fantasy baseball) original and one time
Philly - Kevin Stocker was cut by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.  I'm sure you
were saddened to see one of the better players the Phillies put out at
shortstop get treated so rudely.  I hope all is well with Lisa and the
dogs.  What's the latest with the house hunting and the wedding plans?

Everyone here says hello.

Thanks.

Paul

You're correct, I am saddened to see such a great x-Philly treated so 
poorly.  I often look back 
with wonder at how much ground Stocker would cover at the shortstop position, 
not to mention
his tremendous power for a man of such small stature.  He could only be 
compared to x-Philly
and future hall of famer - Ivan DeJesus.  The only uncertainty is whether or 
not Ivan will elect
to be inducted under the Philly or Cubs uniform.

On the house front,  we purchased one and moved in at the beginning of May.  
It's a fixer-upper.
All our weekends are spent working on it.

I gotta run, but thanks for the email.  Let me know how everything is going 
in your world.  Tell
Rina and the kids we said hi.

Hi Everyone,

I know that there is a whole bunch of you on the receiving end of this EMail
and we haven't seen or spoken to some in quite awhile but know this -- we are
thinking of you and your families!!  Our little (big?) Luke turned 4 months
today so I thought I would share some photos with all of you.  Although we 
have
been guilty of not staying in touch, I hope that the attached photos will 
allow
us to somewhat catch up with you.  It is certainly all about Luke on this end
of the line.  He is happy, healthy and so is Mom and Dad.  Here is hoping that
all is well on your end.  We hope to see everyone soon again some day but 
until
then we wish everyone all the best!

Love,

Todd, Rena, and Luke

Dude,
Didn't really have a chance to tell you how great it was to see you again. It 
was way too long and we should not wait another three years to get together 
again. I can promise you that Mr. Moller will not be drinking piss the next 
time we are out. I don't have your work number, so why don't you send it to 
me or call me in the office at 973 367-7150. Tell Lisa I send my best and let 
me know the next time you are back in Jersey with some time to kill.

Counnnnnnnnn,

What's up?   I heard Conway emailed you the other day about New Orleans.  I'm 
going to 
meet Conway and Jughead in N.O. on Nov 17 - 19 for a weekend getaway.  I just 
booked
my flight a couple days ago and wanted to see if there was any way you could 
make it
down.  It seems Conway has gotten a cheap hotel room with his military 
discount - one of the
perks of working for Uncle Sam.  I'm sorry for the short notice but we just 
decided to do it a 
few days ago.  If you could make it, we'd all love to see you.  If not, we'll 
have to get together
when I'm in NJ over Christmas.  Tell Chris we said hi.  Hope everything is 
going great for the
both of you.  Talk to you soon.

Kevin

Hey Kevin,
We understand you will be coming home in a few weeks.
Do you know the exact date, or did my husband just not tell me?
I'm testing out my email ability since Lisa was able to give me your address
last night.
We're glad to hear all is going well and the the house will be completed
sooner than expected!

Enjoy the heat!!!! Gloria

Dr. Ruscitti:
 
You never responded to my last e-mail lo those many months ago.  How are you?  I hear you're a big fan of Gray Davis.  One thing you can say about Gray, he's colorless.  The poor dishrag is laying the blame at you Texans' feet.  But then, why not?  If I have to listen to G. Bush talking about "nucular" power much longer, I'm going to blame everything on Texas.
 
How's marriage?  How's Enron?  I hope all's well, and that you're about to expand your family.
 
If you have any news, or plan to be out this way, please look me up.
 
Best,
 
Tim

By the way, did  you see the original manuscript for Jack Kerouac's classic novel of the beat  generation went for $2.2 million?  Maybe Lisa can propose an  appropriate toast at Vesuvio's.

As I watched the Lakers pound that Texas  team?oh yeah, San Antonio, I was thinking about the guy Mr. Ruscitti refers to  as "my boy."  As I'm sure you were  both otherwise occupied, you probably missed my boy in action this  afternoon.  He was on what he  termed a "power walk (catchy, don't you think?)," going door to door with  power-saving light bulbs, which he was handing out free of charge to  "emphasize our need to conserve energy."   Boy, my boy is one powerhouse.   You think we could bottle what he's  got?

All                            booze

Dear family and friends,

My contact information is changing.  You won't be able to reach me at this
email address and the work numbers below much longer, as Adaptive Broadband
has filed for bankruptcy.  It's been a long time coming, and I'm already
into my job search, but I'm going to enjoy some time off while I look.

I will be checking the phone and email at work infrequently, and the new
contact information is a better way to get in touch with me.  I'll send
another note when I have a new job.

tsarhatt@yahoo.com

(650) 357-0827  -  home
(650) 576-0873  -  cell - I'll be checking this infrequently

Regards,

Tim Sarhatt

TJ,

Let me let you in on a little secret my man -- you ain't gettin' no break
from the Luke man when 2 pops out, nor are you getting a break from Luke
and/or Daniel Jr. when no 3 is born. There are no breaks to be had in the
parenting arena for about 20 years.

Point 2 -- It pains me so to make this statement, but Stamas might actually
be able to beat me in basketball now since I have no cartilage in my left
knee. The Dr. says that my running days are over (which was obviously a
serious blow to my lifestyle), but more importantly, he said that my
organized hoop days are history too. This is not to say that I can't
contribute the next time that we conduct a demonstration of our skills while
hung over at the Charlotte "Y", but it ain't looking good for me ever
swatting Stamas' ugly jumper into that pretty boy face of his ever again.
Then again, I'm crippled, not dead. Certainly elevation is not required to
stuff him so ... maybe I will.

Go Sooners!

Sweets

Heidi Minyung Suh was born on July 2, 2001 at 12:57PM.  She is a beautiful, healthy little girl weighing 7 lbs 14 oz and 19.5 inches tall.  Both Heidi and mom, Sunnie, are doing very well.  Heidi sleeps and cries when she's hungry and wants milk all the time.  My first daughter Heather thinks Heidi is a play doll, and is somewhat jealous of the attention she's getting.  Our house in Seoul is quite busy with activity with two babies, my parents and Sunnie and I.  Yes, fellas, you can deny it, but you too will become fathers one day.  (Scary thought, eh?)   Apart from the lack of sleep and personal time, it's pretty wonderful!  The JV is doing well, although there's quite a bit of pressure to meet numbers this year.  Hope things are well in Houston for all of you.

Jung

kevin-
unfortuanely most of these are analysts- some of the language is ok to use, but more qualitative than quantitative - this was jsut sent to us - most of them are in house, so be careful if you are printing out anyof them.
 
and i have added in this resume of this guy (trey shenken) who sent me his to show to hunter- i gave it directly to hr as i don't know the guy from adam- he was a frd of a frd and i think his is WAY to long, but had some stuff abt trading:
spk soon rz

Hi everyone,

I've traded in a view of the Gulf for a view of a Mobil station - welcome
back to the NE!  Now all I need to do is survive my first winter in 9 years.
I'll probably be bouncing back and forth between NJ and MD for the next
couple of weeks before taking a trip out to So Cal near the end of the
month. Test Pilot School and the pain begins on the 9th of July.

Hope all is well,

you obviously know the energy market better than most.  My guy at goldman,
Jonathan Raleigh, has been on calpine for 4 years and has killed it, so i'm
just following his lead. as for the futile leadership in ca, i agree.
wouldn't it be nice for you, me , tj, and sweets to run a company or a

good points and yes the Dow just needs one more week like this to trade
under 9000 so 8000 is not a stretch.   Markets typically predict a recession
long before it arrives.  In the second q of this year you will see some sort
of headline that says Recession hits US.  I would buy that day.  As for
california, the worlds 6th largest economy,  energy is obviously your space
but I think that the calpines, capstones, and others are options such as the
contract they received last month.  Hope all is well.  Sweets party was fun.
It was only missing you and TJ. j

No, I didn't go to any parties,either, I started to, but since I had dinner
engagements the two evenings prior, I really wanted to see my boys before
they went to bed! I almost walked into the Amoco party, but only to eat
their food and drink their beer! But then I knew that I would go to the
Torch party and wish I hadn't! Who is Torch, anyway? Where was the Enron
booth? That's like 3 years in a row that Enron hasn't participated! Why is
that? Is it the Enron culture, not to participate in gas functions? Are you
strictly going paperless and wireless? Broadband and such? What do the
troops around you say? Does anybody think it is rather odd that you don't
do that? Just curious, I personally don't give a flip. I went to lunch with
somebody that said Enron had a party Tuesday night. Where was my invite?
Y'know, it's kinda funny because I never really get invited to parties like
Williams or Reliant or Conoco, and the sad thing is, I don't care. Why is
that? So many people make such a big deal about getting hammered when they
go out, I guess I'm just getting old!

     Well, I've got to go out again and treat some mullet to dinner again!
I can't wait for all these people to leave, so I don't have to keep
smiling, keep eating and getting little sleep! OUT!

Did you go to any parties last night??  I was lame, I didn't go to a single

there were some decent ones.  How's life at Duke been?  I haven't talked to
you much
since you've become a big ICE trader.   Talk to you soon.

In that case:
1. Guided tour of Enron Stadium
2. Chauffered transportation to/from Corpus Christi
3. A pound of fifties to spend over the weekend
 
I just checked w/ mapquest and they are estimating a whopping 6 hours for the drive!!!  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I seem to remember it taking about 3.5.
Lowery is doing some more training in San Marco, about 45 minutes north of San Antonio.  I imagine he was staying on the River Walk so he had something to do with Kim.  If he had any balls at all he'd stick around for the weekend.

Sold some of the Ene stock. just saw a clip of moller (like 6 seconds). it 
was a collage of witnesses from the WTC blowup. It was on like the first day 
we got FOX NEWS on our cable. It was pretty shocking.

Take care,

Yo Kev,

What's happening? Hope everything is going okay. How is Lisa and the rest of 
the neighborhood?

It's starting to get cold here. The temperatures are in the high-40's.
Went to Notre Dame last week with dad. It was cool. The campus was 
beautiful; the ride wasn't that bad; and the people were REAL nice (how 
weird?!).

Anyway, dad had a good time, except I think he got pneumonia on the trip. 
"Mr. Sunshine" was dressed up in shorts and a golf shirt for a mid-October 
trip to Indiana. It was 75 degrees when we left Jersey and 45 degrees by the 
time we hit the Ohio border. He can't figure out how he got pneumonia (true 
story). Anyway, I saw him yesterday and he looks and sounds better.

Anyway, Gloria is busy coaching soccer. Her team is 9-4-1 (best record in 
school history). Tommy is busy causing havoc wherever he goes (Takes after 
mommy). His grandparents are driving mommy and daddy nuts (same ol' story).

I hope everything is going all right. Heard the big lobsterfest was a 
success (Nothing like a FRESH Maine lobster). Belated congrats on your first 
anniversary.

Is life pretty tense at Enron (with all the craziness of the world markets, 
terrorism scares and this Anthrax hysteria)? Do you have to go through a 
metal detector or anything like that?

Anyway, I saw Moeller was on TV. Never thought I'd be happy to see his ugly 
mug on the toob!

Well, I've got to go (I'm at work). Talk to you soon.

Love your brother,

PS. Mom and Dad are looking forward to THANKSGIVING with you and Lisa! (Some 
fun, eh?!)

Take care

Sounds good based on 1 condition.  You and ML do not pick up everyone's

We'll just go out to dinner and a show and we'll all split it.  Sounds

Gentlemen - I hope you all are doing well.  I wanted to follow up with
guys
on supper club.  I believe it's our turn in the "rotation".  ML and I
thought it might be fun to change it up a bit and go some place like the
Mucky Duck where we could eat and watch a band or go somewhere like the
Laugh Stop for dinner and a comedy hour.  We will treat on the dinner
and
first round of drinks.  I would say on all drinks but given Kevin's past
rampages with the bottles of wine I better not guarantee full payment of
that at a restaurant.  If that's a problem, I can always bring Kevin a
small
flask and straw that he can have during the night. 

ML talked to Lisa and I talked to Dax and it sounds like Sunday,
November
11th will be the only date that might work.  Follow back up with me and
let
me know if that will work.  Take care and talk to you soon.

Subject: From an acquaintance



I just witnessed something I don't think I'll ever forget.  I was down near
the cafeteria in the Pentagon meeting a friend for lunch and I see a very
large crowd of people inside.  I walk in and soon find myself standing less
than three feet away from our Commander-in-Chief and right beside the
Secretary of Defense (and a bunch of Secret Service folks).

President Bush was walking around shaking hands and thanking all of us for
what we do.  He kept saying to people "Don't Worry" -- as if to say, I've
got it under control.  He must have shaken 1000 hands or more.  What
particularly struck me was his presence - not a particularly large man in
stature, but he had an aura of a giant - a smile on his face, yet you can
sense he was a man on a mission - a man of purpose and conviction - there
was just this feeling that he is ! THE MAN, and he is in charge - he had a
quiet confidence that was deafening!

Then, a group of folks just behind me started singing God Bless America
and, in no time, the entire room - which was packed - was singing the song.
It was enough to give anyone goose bumps.  If there was a dry eye in the
place, I couldn't see it (probably because my eyes weren't too dry).  It
was just one of those once in a life time experiences that I shall never
forget.  After God Bless America, there were a few chants of "USA -
USA-USA," followed by a lot of applause.

When President Bush finally made his way toward the entrance, he turned
with his confident smile and waved at everyone, and the room just erupted
in cheers and whistles and applause.  I've been to professional football
games where the noise wasn't that loud.  It was just such a wonderful
experience - and it made me:

1) So very happy that George W. Bush is our president and
Commander-in-Chief.
2) So proud to be an American.

Just thought I'd share.

  Subject: Re: you are a dork


  Ed,

  Sorry, but I must concur with Mr.Claffey.

  I do believe the question posed asked to list specific outfield postions
(ie: Leftfield, Centefield and Rightfield) which your suprisingly quick
response failed to address.  Most of the great ballplayers played certain
"outfield" positions based on their fielding abilities or lack thereof to
play the other outfield positions.

  I'll let you slide (barely) on your broad references to "outfield" on
Roger Maris and Dale Murphy and Barry Bonds, however,

  No true baseball expert would ever be so casual as to list Mickey Mantle's
position as simply "Outfield"

  I believe you owe baseball fans, especially the Yankee snobs (I was always
a Mets fan) an apology for so boldly disrespecting the position of
Centerfield.

  Rob

Kamp,

I think you have to give up on your dream of being a game show host.
You certainly have the teethy smile,  but you display too much
confidence that you are  the only one with the Top-Secret answers.

You are the weakest link.


The answers:

Haal Newhouser  - Pitcher

Yoggie Berra  -  Catcher

Jimmie Fox  - first base           Alos,  Frank Thomas

Ernie Banks  - SS

Joe Morgan  - 2nd base

Mike Schmidt  - 3-B

Mickey Mantle - outfield

Roger Marris -  Outfield

Dale Murphy  - OF         Barry bonds  - OF

***Rich Kampman  (4 Time Winner)  -  S.F  Short-Fielder.     M.L.S.
(Major League Softball)

*** I don't think this would count,  although the Short-Fielder is
another position.  And Kamp did play the position with class




Please refer to for proof.

After 3 years of Enron I have decided to make a change in career paths. Eff=
ective June 1, I will take over as the Director of Youth Ministries at Grac=
e Bible Church in Dallas, TX. I have always considered doing this and the o=
pportunity presented itself. Jamie and I decided that now was the best time=
 (no kids and no debt). The job also offers a full scholarship to Dallas Th=
eological Seminary, so now I can finish Seminary in 4 years instead of 7. I=
 have enjoyed working with all of you and wish you much success in the futu=
re.

Hope to see you at the Happy Hour Berney is throwing for me at the Blue Aga=
ve (Waugh & Gray) @6pm on Thursday, May 3!!!

Starting May 18th you can reach me at the following:

I figured we all needed a break from all the 9/11 and Retaliation news we've received lately.

To get everyone in the postseason frame of mind here is a trivia question I'm sure will stump the most avid basebvall fan.

 

There has been an MVP who reveived the award two years in a row at each position (center field has two), including at pitcher.  Name them.  

I will share the answers in a future email.  I'm thinking Bert or DiLeo are the only ones who have half a chance at this one.  Prove me wrong.

Pitcher :

Catcher:

First Base: (no it was not Rich Kampmann)

Second Base:

Third Base:

Short Stop:

Left Field:

Center Field:

Right Field:

Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  "The company is overlevered; that's a fact."--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a "new approach", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

In order to continually develop and make improvements to the functionality of EnronOnline we are rolling out several changes tonight, which will be in effect on Monday August 20, 2001. Some of these changes will affect Stack Manager while others affect the Website. A summary of these changes is listed below.

Stack Manager Changes

Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a " Top of Stack Entry" it will create back to back transactions; one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.

In order to turn on this functionality select the " Allowed Top of Stack" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the "Allowed"  option should be selected.

Please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out.

Restricted Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a " Top of Stack Entry" it will create back to back transactions one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.

In order to turn on this functionality select the " allowed as Restricted Top of Stack" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the "Allowed"  option should be selected. If a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the "Restricted Top of Stack" feature.

Advanced Filtering Ability on All Products Tab -  Drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the All Products tab in stack manager. In order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title. A drop down box with a list of attributes will appear. Highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter. To turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the " All" option from the drop down box.


Website Changes

New Submission Screen for Restricted Top of Stack Limit Orders -  The submission screen for  products that allow  Top of Stack or Restricted Top of Stack limit orders is as follows.
 

The submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction, while the button on the right will submit as a limit order.  In case of the Restricted Top of Stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box. 

Price of Limit Orders 

Modify Limit Orders
 Customers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order. In order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on  at the top of the "Today's Orders" section. The price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product. Once the price is at the desired level click the "Set" button and the price will be modified. Another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order.  You will see a box with plus, minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order.

Expiration time for Limit Orders
Customers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days. Currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours.

Float the Today's Orders Section
You can now float the " Limit Order " section. In order to do so, right click in the "Today's Orders " section and select the float window option. In order to make the window " Stay On Top " right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option.

Mid Market Client - Mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers, while including their desired margin on the trade, on EnronOnline products. In order to do so Click on the bid or offer price, a customised submission window will appear.  Select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit. For example if a customer wants to buy Nymex Sep 01 at 3.36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin, please enter 3.36 as the desired price and 0.01 as the margin. The system will trade the order when the EnronOnline offer for Nymex Sep 01 is at 3.35, book the trade at 3.36 and record the 0.01 origination amount.

In order to be set up to use this functionality. Please call the EnronOnline Product Control Group.

Changes to Website Passwords - As an added security measure, which has been requested by many customers, some new password rules have been instituted. First, the password cannot be equal to the login ID. Second, each user will be prompted to change his password every 90 days. These rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users.


Please note  Stack Manager changes will be available all traders as of Monday August 20, 2001. The changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on Monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded Monday night, and external users by the end of the week.  Over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords.

If you have any questions regarding these changes please contact me at 713-853-1787.

Subject: EPNG Blanco NonBondad

David,

Could you take a few minutes to review the attached new location EPNG 
NonBondad.  Tori Kuykendall from the west desk has told us she wants the same 
language that SoCal Topock has due to the fact that the EPNG NonBondad 
section of the pipeline has a history of breaking down and being interrupted 
all the time.  

Thank you,

Melba

Existing:
EPNG SoCal Topock
The transaction is for delivery at the Southern California Gas Company -  
Topock interconnect with El Paso Natural Gas.  The volumes scheduled to be 
delivered are subject to reductions due to normal operational constraints on 
both El Paso Natural Gas and Southern California Gas Company pipelines based 
upon historical operating conditions.  The reductions caused by these 
constraints are excused nonperformance and are not considered a failure to 
receive or deliver firm gas.

New:
EPNG Blanco NonBondad
The transaction is for delivery at El Paso San Juan Blanco non-Bondad.  The 
volumes scheduled to be delivered are subject to reductions due to normal 
operational constraints on El Paso Natural Gas Pipelines based upon 
historical operating conditions.  The reductions caused by these constraints 
are excused nonperformance and are not considered a failure to receive or 
deliver firm gas.

Kevin Ruscetti would like to trade Physical Index transactions for delivery 
to ANR ML7 based on the above referenced Index. He tells me that it is widely 
known that delivery at ANR ML7 is secondary firm, and states that if allowed 
to transact on this the language would need to state that the parties would 
employ their 'best efforts' to deliver.

Joe - can you try and find me some Confirm language for this.

Comments, please.

Kevin,

I need to follow up with Stacy Dickson on any possible revisions to the GTC.  Also, it has been mentioned to me that the long description that appears on the website should include specific details as to when and how the buyer needs to notify Enron of the delivery point, alternate delivery point, or where they plan to park/store the gas.  I'll get with you on Tuesday after I talk with Stacy about this.

CW
3-7533

A US gas transaction with Enron North America Corp., under which Seller shall sell and Buyer shall purchase a quantity of natural gas equal to the Daily Contract Quantity at the Contract Price on a Secondary Firm basis.  The Contract Price shall be as submitted by Counterparty via the Website.  The Period of Delivery shall be from the Effective Date through the Termination Date.
The term of the Transaction shall be from the Effective Date to the Termination Date. The Effective Date is 01 May 2001. The Termination Date is 31 May 2001.
The Transaction is for delivery at an ANR Pipeline Company ML7 interconnect.  The Purchaser will determine at what ML7 interconnect to take delivery.  The volumes Delivered by the Seller are subject to reductions due to operational constraints on the ANR Pipeline system. In the event that scheduled volumes are reduced due to pipeline operational constraints, Buyer will designate an alternate ML7 delivery location until an unconstrained point is designated.  In the event that the Buyer cannot take receipt at an alternative ML7 point, the Buyer must arrange for the gas to be delivered off-system, stored or parked at the Buyer's expense. These reductions due to Pipeline System constraints are not considered a failure to perform by the Purchaser.
The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the Contractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be millions of British thermal units and the quantity shown shall be in millions of BTUs per day

Kevin Ruscitti has requested a secondary firm ANR ML7 phy gas product for EOL.  I have located some language that you and Dale worked on back in May of 2000.  Please let me know if this language will be OK for our needs.  Also, will the current GTC for Phy gas need to be revised in any way?

Thanks,

CW

Classmates,

The reunion is rapidly approaching!  I think we have been able to get ahold
of just about everyone now, and it looks like there will be a very big
turn-out ... thanks for taking the time to let us know your plans!!   Also,
special thanks to Constantine for doing a bang-up job on recruiting,
especially among the New York contingent!

Now that we have gotten the word out, its time to collect a few bucks to pay
for these great events!  If you haven't already submitted your Registration
you can do so in one of at least two ways:

1)  Return the flyer from the Alumni Office that you received in the mail.
This has pricing for all the events and should be received in plenty of time
if you send it this week or early next.   Note:  if you didn't get the
packet, then you probably need to update your info on the alumni database --
go to http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/alumni/.

2)  Register Online by going to the Reunion Homepage at
http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/alumni/reunions.html  (note:  this is a link to
the main Reunion site with info on all events).   There is a secure form
there with all the pricing, info and a credit card processing function.
Nice!

Either way should work, please note that you will only be able to do the
Online Registration through Oct 31st so please get on it!

Couple of points of clarification regarding the pricing and events!

1)  You will see reference to two separate events happening the same
weekend, the Alumni Conference and the various Class Reunions (1996, 1991,
1986, etc)!   Just think of all these events as one series of activities
designed for your reunioning pleasure and pick and choose what you would
like to attend w/ special attention to anything that says "Class of 1996".
For a list of all events, visit the Reunion web site (link shown above).

2)  You will notice that there are two BBQ lunches on Saturday.  There is a
Class of 1996 event at Will Rogers State Park, and there is a separate event
on the North Lawn at UCLA for everyone else.  You can attend either event
(or both for that matter), but I would encourage you to go to the Class of
1996 event because that is where all of your friends will be!

3)  Pricing for the events is listed on the Registration page, but a quick
summary is as follows (simplified version):

Conference Events
---------------------------
Beer Bust (Fri night) - $15/person    Note:  All classes will attend
Building Your Knowledge Portfolio I (Fri day) - $75/person
Building Your Knowledge Portfolio II (Sat day) - $50/person
Alumni BBQ Picnic (Sat day) - $10/person

Reunion Events
--------------------------
Class of 1996 BBQ Picnic (Sat day) - $15/person
Class of 1996 Reunion Dinner (Sat night) - $65/person
Class of 1996 Golf Tourney (Sun day) - $65/person

Package Pricing
--------------------------
Alumni Conference package - $135/person - includes Beer Bust, 2-Days of
Knowledge Portfolio and Alumni BBQ Picnic***
Alumni Conference + Reunion Events - $TBD/person    Note:  this isn't listed
yet, but should be on the site shortly ~$270/person

***Important:  If you buy the Alumni Conference package, which includes a
ticket to the Alumni BBQ Picnic, go ahead and use the ticket to attend the
Class of 1996 BBQ Picnic!   Keep the extra $5 and buy Constantine a beer for
us okay!

4)  The Class of 1996 BBQ Picnic starts at 11:30am and is located at Will
Rogers State Park in Pacific Palisades.  Please note that this is different
from Will Rogers State Beach.  The park is located North of Sunset Blvd.
between Amalfi Drive & Chautauqua.  Should be very warm and a great location
for a BBQ!!

Hope this information is helpful, please let us know if you need more!   In
the mean time, the planning continues and we hope this is a great event!

Looking forward to seeing you in LA!!

Sincerely,
Steve Smith
On behalf of Pete, Lynne, Melissa and many, many Reunion Organizers

Dude,
Good thing I took some of my Pru 401K $$ and bought Enron in February, when
I opened my roll-over IRA.

Besides the job how's everything else going with you and the lovely Lisa?

Things could not be more hectic over here. I'm switching jobs next month.
Gave the dot.com world a shot and timed it wrong. When the company you are
working for is borrowing $$ from the VC to meet payroll and has not locked
in the final round of funding, you know it is time to move along. Will be
joining a NY Real Estate Brokerage House, where I'm friend with the guys.
Will be helping them run their Corporate Service Group.

Lets see what else is going on.

Chrissy is trying to decide if she is going to volunteer for the Merrill
Lynch layoff package that is being offered. I want her to, because her boss
is making her life miserable.

My father had triple by-pass surgery last month. He is doing fine now and it
is probably for the better in the long run that he had the procedure done.

And on good note- My brother got engaged.

I lost Mr. Conway's tele # and email address, can you shoot it over to me.
Would like to drop him a message. Is he still State side? hopefully.

Remember to drop me a note when you finalize your visit back to NJ in
January, so we can hook up.

Tell Lisa and the family that we send our regards,

Jonathan R. Coun
Vice President, SPACEdirect Development

Subject: Anderson '96 Reunion - 4 weeks away!


Dear Class of 1996,

**Note:  Response to this email requested, thanks!

Well, our much anticipated 5-year Reunion is less than a month away!
The
planning committe is working hard on the events, and we are trying to
firm
up the list of attendees.  We got a GREAT response to the last email,
thanks
for taking the time to let us know your status.  If you haven't
responded
yet, please do so just so we can adequately reserve space.

Just to remind some of you, the event will take place on: *** November
2-4th
*** in Los Angeles, CA!   The rough schedule of events is shown below.
In a
subsequent email today or tomorrow we will provide some details about
hotel
accommodations.  You will also be receiving an information packet from
the
Alumni Office in a mailing that should be out next week.

If you are planning to fly I've heard there are some great deals on
Southwest and United among others (<$100 from SF).  Anderson Alums also
get
a 10% on Southwest (see below)

If you would like to respond to this email regarding your status, please
use
this form:

1) Status of your email account
	A)  Got this info - email address is correct
	B)  Got this info - but would prefer to use another address next
time
	C)  I did not get this info (not sure how you would answer this,
but...)

Note:  You may have received this note twice - it was sent to all
members of
the Class of 1996 currently registered in the Alumni Database, as well
as to
the Class of 1996 Email List (which is opt-in).

2) Plans for attending the Reunion Weekend
	A)  Will definitely be Attending
	B)  Will make a brief appearance (1 or 2 events)
	C)  Still Deciding
	D)  Will not be Attending (but wish I could)

3) Comments/Suggestions - Any thoughts on how to make this a GREAT
reunion?

As mentioned previously, its been a rough year for many of us and it
would
be great to end the year with some fun and good times!  I can tell you
from
what we've been hearing, and from the number of responses received, that
we
are going to have an awesome turnout for the events, so you don't want
to
miss out!!!   So get your tickets, review your facebook (so who was that
Doug Dahl character anyways), dust off the old Anderson attire and let's
party!!

Sincerely,
Steve Smith
On behalf of Pete, Lynne, Melissa and many, many Reunion Organizers

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

We will be releasing new version of the Stack Manager and the EnronOnline website tonight . The following are the changes

1. Changes to Stack Manager:

1.1 Changes to toolbar icons:
To facilitate further development of the system, it has been found necessary to change the toolbar icons at the top of the Stack  Manager. The attached file shows the old icon and its new replacement. Next to each image below is the description of the function that is executed as well as the short cut key that is mapped to the same function:

 

1.2 New Functionality - Auto Suspend
The Auto Suspend function allows traders to set an absolute price change from a price level at which you would like the system to automatically suspend a specific product. This function is useful if your products use automatic price resets.

To activate this feature:
1. Select a product and click on Product Properties
2. Check the Enable box
3. Enter the Price Check and Suspend at +/- values
4. Click Update
Example: a trader Enables Auto Suspend and selects a $35.00 Price Check and a suspension level of +/- $5.00: The system will suspend the product when the mid price is above  $40.00 or below $30.00

You will need to enter a new Price Check or disable the Auto Suspend function to reactivate this Product if the Auto Suspend is triggered.  
Please note the system checks for any products that need to be suspended once a minute.


2. Changes to EnronOnline Website
 (These changes will be rolled out in phases over the next week and will be available to all customers only by Friday 5/4/01)

The following enhancements have been made to the EnronOnline Website:

2.1 Today's Transactions

Float Window:  In order to float the window, right click on the Today's Transactions section, click on the Float Window option.

Sort Ordering: Click on the column heading to change the sort order. 

Linked Transactions: You can display the linked Transactions in an expanded or collapsed view. To do so, right click in the Transaction display area and select full Expand or Full Collapse.

2.2 Submission Box

The submission box has been modified in order to show a space between each set of "zeros" for the volume the customer wants to sell/buy.

entertainment service.  Founded in 1990 as a unit of Hughes
Electronics Corporation, the DIRECTV? service was 
introduced to the public in June 1994.  In it's first two 
years, the DIRECTV System--an 18" satellite dish, set top 
digital receiver and remote control--became the fastest 
selling consumer electronics product introduction in U.S. 
history, surpassing the VCR and CD player.

DIRECTV has continued to grow at a record pace.  Including 
the acquisitions of U.S. Satellite Broadcasting (USSB) and 
PRIMESTAR in 1999, DIRECTV has already grown to over 10 
million subscribers and become the third largest 
programming provider in the U.S.

>From the start, DIRECTV has been an innovator and 
technological leader.  With the utilization of a growing 
fleet of high-powered satellites in stationary orbit above 
North America, DIRECTV is the first entertainment service 
to deliver multi-channel, digital video and audio 
programming to an 18-inch satellite dish.  With over 225 
channels, 31 music channels, sports, movie and 
entertainment packages, special events and near video 
on-demand pay-per-view broadcasts, DIRECTV? programming is 
varied and wide.  In addition, the DIRECTV PARA TODOS? 
service was launched in October 1999, which provides 
Spanish and English programming developed for the US-based 
multi-generation Hispanic households.

DIRECTV continues to break new ground.  With strategic 
partnerships and equity investments in other entertainment,
Internet and multi-media leaders, DIRECTV is creating the 
future of home entertainment today.  By aligning with such 
companies as AOL, TiVo, XM Satellite Radio and Wink, new 
products and services will be launched in the coming months
and years that will lead the way into interactive 
television and home entertainment and services.

Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

To remain consistent with Enron's directive to improve security access to the building, all Enron Body Shop members are required to check-in at the Body Shop Front Desk and present an Enron Photo ID badge or another form of Photo ID to the Security Officer each time you visit.  To assist our members who participate in outdoor activities during their visit, Security SMART ID tags are available at the Body Shop Front Desk for your convenience.  Simply slide the SMART ID tag through the shoe laces between an eyelet and snap the tag closed.  

The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members are exercising off property as well as provide the security identification verification required when entering the Body Shop.  Each day you plan to exercise outside, present your Enron Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.  Your Photo ID will be returned to you when you return the SMART ID tag to the Front Desk at the end of your visit.

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Yo Kev,

What's happening? Hope everything is going okay. How is Lisa and the rest of 
the neighborhood?

It's starting to get cold here. The temperatures are in the high-40's.
Went to Notre Dame last week with dad. It was cool. The campus was 
beautiful; the ride wasn't that bad; and the people were REAL nice (how 
weird?!).

Anyway, dad had a good time, except I think he got pneumonia on the trip. 
"Mr. Sunshine" was dressed up in shorts and a golf shirt for a mid-October 
trip to Indiana. It was 75 degrees when we left Jersey and 45 degrees by the 
time we hit the Ohio border. He can't figure out how he got pneumonia (true 
story). Anyway, I saw him yesterday and he looks and sounds better.

Anyway, Gloria is busy coaching soccer. Her team is 9-4-1 (best record in 
school history). Tommy is busy causing havoc wherever he goes (Takes after 
mommy). His grandparents are driving mommy and daddy nuts (same ol' story).

I hope everything is going all right. Heard the big lobsterfest was a 
success (Nothing like a FRESH Maine lobster). Belated congrats on your first 
anniversary.

Is life pretty tense at Enron (with all the craziness of the world markets, 
terrorism scares and this Anthrax hysteria)? Do you have to go through a 
metal detector or anything like that?

Anyway, I saw Moeller was on TV. Never thought I'd be happy to see his ugly 
mug on the toob!

Well, I've got to go (I'm at work). Talk to you soon.

Love your brother,

PS. Mom and Dad are looking forward to THANKSGIVING with you and Lisa! (Some 
fun, eh?!)

Take care

Sounds good based on 1 condition.  You and ML do not pick up everyone's
dinner.
We'll just go out to dinner and a show and we'll all split it.  Sounds
like 
fun.  Good idea - must've been ML's.

Gentlemen - I hope you all are doing well.  I wanted to follow up with
guys
on supper club.  I believe it's our turn in the "rotation".  ML and I
thought it might be fun to change it up a bit and go some place like the
Mucky Duck where we could eat and watch a band or go somewhere like the
Laugh Stop for dinner and a comedy hour.  We will treat on the dinner
and
first round of drinks.  I would say on all drinks but given Kevin's past
rampages with the bottles of wine I better not guarantee full payment of
that at a restaurant.  If that's a problem, I can always bring Kevin a
small
flask and straw that he can have during the night. 

ML talked to Lisa and I talked to Dax and it sounds like Sunday,
November
11th will be the only date that might work.  Follow back up with me and
let
me know if that will work.  Take care and talk to you soon.

The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

Dear Kevin, 

 <http://expedia.cq0.net/r/default.asp?R=000088a43000091f3&rfrr=-1410> If you're like us, you've been looking forward to cooler weather, falling snow ... and opening day for skiing and snowboarding! This year, planning that ski trip with family or friends is easier than ever, with Expedia Ski Vacations. Not only will you get low prices, but you can get everything you need for the perfect trip online -- yes, even your rental skis or board and lift tickets! Plus, if you book by November 19, you can get a free ski lift ticket <http://expedia.cq0.net/r/default.asp?R=000088a43000091f3&rfrr=-1410> with your ski vacation. 

Thinking snow? Nothing gets you in the mood for the slopes like a Warren Miller movie <http://expedia.cq0.net/r/default.asp?R=000088a8a000091f3&rfrr=-1410>. Expedia.com is a proud sponsor of the latest thriller from this master of the mountains -- see it in a town near you!

Gentlemen - I hope you all are doing well.  I wanted to follow up with guys
on supper club.  I believe it's our turn in the "rotation".  ML and I
thought it might be fun to change it up a bit and go some place like the
Mucky Duck where we could eat and watch a band or go somewhere like the
Laugh Stop for dinner and a comedy hour.  We will treat on the dinner and
first round of drinks.  I would say on all drinks but given Kevin's past
rampages with the bottles of wine I better not guarantee full payment of
that at a restaurant.  If that's a problem, I can always bring Kevin a small
flask and straw that he can have during the night. 

ML talked to Lisa and I talked to Dax and it sounds like Sunday, November
11th will be the only date that might work.  Follow back up with me and let
me know if that will work.  Take care and talk to you soon.

Hi,

	 	The power options trading desk is beginning to structure deals and to make markets in spark spread options ( options on the spreads between power prices and natural gas prices).  Please refer to the attached file for further information.   
	

 	   	It would be most helpful to meet with the relevant individuals  on the Gas desk  who would be interested in spark spread options.

   	
	 	 Thank you in advance for your assistance.
    
Kind regards,

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

I just witnessed something I don't think I'll ever forget.  I was down near
the cafeteria in the Pentagon meeting a friend for lunch and I see a very
large crowd of people inside.  I walk in and soon find myself standing less
than three feet away from our Commander-in-Chief and right beside the
Secretary of Defense (and a bunch of Secret Service folks).

President Bush was walking around shaking hands and thanking all of us for
what we do.  He kept saying to people "Don't Worry" -- as if to say, I've
got it under control.  He must have shaken 1000 hands or more.  What
particularly struck me was his presence - not a particularly large man in
stature, but he had an aura of a giant - a smile on his face, yet you can
sense he was a man on a mission - a man of purpose and conviction - there
was just this feeling that he is ! THE MAN, and he is in charge - he had a
quiet confidence that was deafening!

Then, a group of folks just behind me started singing God Bless America
and, in no time, the entire room - which was packed - was singing the song.
It was enough to give anyone goose bumps.  If there was a dry eye in the
place, I couldn't see it (probably because my eyes weren't too dry).  It
was just one of those once in a life time experiences that I shall never
forget.  After God Bless America, there were a few chants of "USA -
USA-USA," followed by a lot of applause.

When President Bush finally made his way toward the entrance, he turned
with his confident smile and waved at everyone, and the room just erupted
in cheers and whistles and applause.  I've been to professional football
games where the noise wasn't that loud.  It was just such a wonderful
experience - and it made me:

1) So very happy that George W. Bush is our president and
Commander-in-Chief.
2) So proud to be an American.

Just thought I'd share.

C'mon you can play 18 then do housework all afternoon.  If you're just starting you don't get many invitations!  Truthfully, I'm usually napping after golf, you're always surprised how tired you get after 18 holes!

I've gotten some interest from various groups within EES, EGM and hopefully Industrial Markets, but it's tough.  Everybody is cautious, nobody's going gangbusters.  I've been pounding the pavement almost full time for 2 weeks.  Need to close something before heading back to Seoul.  I brought my family back to Houston and they're staying, but I'll head back to Seoul in a week or 2.

Jung

p.s.  thanks for your lead on Mike Curry, but he had just hired a manager so nothing for now.

Dear Class of 1996,

**Note:  Response to this email requested, thanks!

Well, our much anticipated 5-year Reunion is less than a month away!  The
planning committe is working hard on the events, and we are trying to firm
up the list of attendees.  We got a GREAT response to the last email, thanks
for taking the time to let us know your status.  If you haven't responded
yet, please do so just so we can adequately reserve space.

Just to remind some of you, the event will take place on: *** November 2-4th
*** in Los Angeles, CA!   The rough schedule of events is shown below.  In a
subsequent email today or tomorrow we will provide some details about hotel
accommodations.  You will also be receiving an information packet from the
Alumni Office in a mailing that should be out next week.

If you are planning to fly I've heard there are some great deals on
Southwest and United among others (<$100 from SF).  Anderson Alums also get
a 10% on Southwest (see below)

If you would like to respond to this email regarding your status, please use
this form:

1) Status of your email account
	A)  Got this info - email address is correct
	B)  Got this info - but would prefer to use another address next time
	C)  I did not get this info (not sure how you would answer this, but...)

Note:  You may have received this note twice - it was sent to all members of
the Class of 1996 currently registered in the Alumni Database, as well as to
the Class of 1996 Email List (which is opt-in).

2) Plans for attending the Reunion Weekend
	A)  Will definitely be Attending
	B)  Will make a brief appearance (1 or 2 events)
	C)  Still Deciding
	D)  Will not be Attending (but wish I could)

3) Comments/Suggestions - Any thoughts on how to make this a GREAT reunion?

As mentioned previously, its been a rough year for many of us and it would
be great to end the year with some fun and good times!  I can tell you from
what we've been hearing, and from the number of responses received, that we
are going to have an awesome turnout for the events, so you don't want to
miss out!!!   So get your tickets, review your facebook (so who was that
Doug Dahl character anyways), dust off the old Anderson attire and let's
party!!

Sincerely,
Steve Smith
On behalf of Pete, Lynne, Melissa and many, many Reunion Organizers

Kevin,

Per our conversation this morning, the attached spreadsheet should give you an idea how we are managing NGPL NSS storage.  The spreadsheet breaks out the current inventory level and the daily rights associated with the storage.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Ed, 

Sorry, but I must concur with Mr.Claffey. 

I do believe the question posed asked to list specific outfield postions (ie: Leftfield, Centefield and Rightfield) which your suprisingly quick response failed to address.  Most of the great ballplayers played certain "outfield" positions based on their fielding abilities or lack thereof to play the other outfield positions. 

I'll let you slide (barely) on your broad references to "outfield" on Roger Maris and Dale Murphy and Barry Bonds, however, 

No true baseball expert would ever be so casual as to list Mickey Mantle's position as simply "Outfield" 

I believe you owe baseball fans, especially the Yankee snobs (I was always a Mets fan) an apology for so boldly disrespecting the position of Centerfield.

Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Som=
e of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personne=
l) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, =
there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all th=
e steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our faciliti=
es and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of securi=
ty, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business con=
trols organization.  You can contact this organization through their websit=
e (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email =
(CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John B=
rindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Pleas=
e feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, =
or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for t=
he Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be ins=
tituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?=09As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron =
Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?=09Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid =
picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S=
. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identif=
ication).=20

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing=
 in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor ca=
rd.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. o=
r foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identifica=
tion) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?=09Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or b=
adged contractor at all times.

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron emplo=
yee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby receptio=
n area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointm=
ent.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to=
 the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected=
, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the =
escorting employee or badged contractor.

?=09Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their =
workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Secu=
rity (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to y=
ou or hold doors open, allowing "tail gating" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instit=
uted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times=
 in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equi=
pment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand the=
se measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. =09


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommenda=
tions:

?=09While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommend=
s that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to str=
ongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pak=
istan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Geo=
rgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that =
planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Ara=
bia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?=09For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate securit=
y recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent =
reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being question=
ed and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a re=
sult, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the Uni=
ted States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry th=
eir passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest=
 that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card=
 as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immi=
gration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and National=
ity Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her "regi=
stration" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanen=
t Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Cros=
sing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not his=
torically been asking domestic travelers for "registration" documentation, =
but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it=
 would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your c=
urrent lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corpor=
ate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

Many of you have requested more time in which to submit your nominations for the 2001 Chairman's Award. In response to your requests, the deadline has been extended to Friday, October 12.

Please take this extended opportunity to nominate that special individual who is your everyday hero and a role model who exemplifies Enron's core values of Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence.

This award represents how important Enron's core values are to the company. The success of this award program is determined by Enron's most valuable asset, you, the employee. Employees at any level can nominate fellow employees from anywhere within the Enron family - from the top down or the bottom up. All of those employees who have been nominated in the past are eligible to be nominated again this year and there is no limit to the number of nominations you may submit. Simply complete a nomination form and submit it by Friday, October 12, 2001. Forms can be obtained by visiting your intranet site or at home.enron.com and in Houston they are available in the elevator lobbies. In addition, this year we have a new way you can nominate that everyday Enron hero. Simply pick up the phone and dial 713-345-2492, follow the simple and quick instructions and leave your nomination by phone.

The finalists for the award, the Chairman's Roundtable, and the Chairman's Award winner will be honored at Enron's Management Conference in San Antonio on November 15.

Thank you for your participation.

Kevin,

I need to follow up with Stacy Dickson on any possible revisions to the GTC.  Also, it has been mentioned to me that the long description that appears on the website should include specific details as to when and how the buyer needs to notify Enron of the delivery point, alternate delivery point, or where they plan to park/store the gas.  I'll get with you on Tuesday after I talk with Stacy about this.

CW
3-7533

A US gas transaction with Enron North America Corp., under which Seller shall sell and Buyer shall purchase a quantity of natural gas equal to the Daily Contract Quantity at the Contract Price on a Secondary Firm basis.  The Contract Price shall be as submitted by Counterparty via the Website.  The Period of Delivery shall be from the Effective Date through the Termination Date.
The term of the Transaction shall be from the Effective Date to the Termination Date. The Effective Date is 01 May 2001. The Termination Date is 31 May 2001.
The Transaction is for delivery at an ANR Pipeline Company ML7 interconnect.  The Purchaser will determine at what ML7 interconnect to take delivery.  The volumes Delivered by the Seller are subject to reductions due to operational constraints on the ANR Pipeline system. In the event that scheduled volumes are reduced due to pipeline operational constraints, Buyer will designate an alternate ML7 delivery location until an unconstrained point is designated.  In the event that the Buyer cannot take receipt at an alternative ML7 point, the Buyer must arrange for the gas to be delivered off-system, stored or parked at the Buyer's expense. These reductions due to Pipeline System constraints are not considered a failure to perform by the Purchaser.
The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the Contractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be millions of British thermal units and the quantity shown shall be in millions of BTUs per day

Stacy,

Kevin Ruscitti has requested a secondary firm ANR ML7 phy gas product for EOL.  I have located some language that you and Dale worked on back in May of 2000.  Please let me know if this language will be OK for our needs.  Also, will the current GTC for Phy gas need to be revised in any way?

Thanks,

Subject: Baseball Trivia



I figured we all needed a break from all the 9/11 and Retaliation news
we've received lately.

To get everyone in the postseason frame of mind here is a trivia
question I'm sure will stump the most avid basebvall fan.

 

There has been an MVP who reveived the award two years in a row at each
position (center field has two), including at pitcher.  Name them.  

I will share the answers in a future email.  I'm thinking Bert or DiLeo
are the only ones who have half a chance at this one.  Prove me wrong.

Pitcher :

Catcher:

First Base: (no it was not Rich Kampmann)

Second Base:

Third Base:

Short Stop:

Left Field:

Center Field:

Right Field:

Here's my attempt.  No reference books or web searches were used in the preparation of this email.  Afterward I researched it and found out how miserable I did.  Here is the link.  Kamp, it looks like there might be two for the 1B category as well.  Sorry you didn't make it.
 
<http://baseball-almanac.com/awards/aw_mvp.shtml>
 
Hope you're all doing well!  GO YANKS!!

There has been an MVP who reveived the award two years in a row at each position (center field has two), including at pitcher.  Name them.  

I will share the answers in a future email.  I'm thinking Bert or DiLeo are the only ones who have half a chance at this one.  Prove me wrong.

Pitcher :[Claffey, Jim] Roger Clemens

Catcher:[Claffey, Jim] Yogi Berra (this is a lock)

First Base: (no it was not Rich Kampmann)[Claffey, Jim] I was gonna guess you!  How about Gehrig? Carew?

Second Base:[Claffey, Jim]   I haven't a clue but will stab at Joe Morgan (only because I liked that thing he did with his armpit when he batted.  My brothers and I learned to make the farting noise with our arms from him!

Third Base:[Claffey, Jim] Mike Schmidt (No doubt about this one)

Short Stop:[Claffey, Jim] Robin Yount?

Left Field:[Claffey, Jim] Mickey Mantle 

Center Field:[Claffey, Jim] Joe Dimaggio and Dale Murphy (I had help on Murphy from some Braves fans)

Right Field:[Claffey, Jim] Roger Maris ?

Kamp,

I think you have to give up on your dream of being a game show host.
You certainly have the teethy smile,  but you display too much
confidence that you are  the only one with the Top-Secret answers.

You are the weakest link.


The answers:

Haal Newhouser  - Pitcher

Yoggie Berra  -  Catcher

Jimmie Fox  - first base           Alos,  Frank Thomas

Ernie Banks  - SS

Joe Morgan  - 2nd base

Mike Schmidt  - 3-B

Mickey Mantle - outfield

Roger Marris -  Outfield

Dale Murphy  - OF         Barry bonds  - OF

***Rich Kampman  (4 Time Winner)  -  S.F  Short-Fielder.     M.L.S.
(Major League Softball)

*** I don't think this would count,  although the Short-Fielder is
another position.  And Kamp did play the position with class




Please refer to for proof.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan enrollment runs from May 7 through May 16

Employees of Reliant Resources, Inc. (RRI) should receive their enrollment
packets for the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) at their work locations
today or early next week. The ESPP allows RRI employees to purchase RRI
stock at a 15% discount through payroll deductions. It is NOT the same
program as the Directed Share Program.

The ESPP enrollment packet contains five items:

   a letter with your ESPP personal identification number;
   a prospectus for RRI;
   a detailed enrollment brochure;
   maps of the automated phone system and Web enrollment tool for easy
   navigation; and
   a beneficiary designation form.

Enrollment for the ESPP will take place between Monday, May 7 through
Wednesday, May 16, 2001. Employees may enroll online, through an automated
telephone service or by speaking with a customer service representative.

If you have not received your packet by Wednesday, May 9 or if your packet
does not contain the correct materials, call Mellon Investor Services, the
record keeper for the ESPP, at 1-866-789-ESPP (3777).

Last night was the game to catch.  Where your seats near where the homer
dropped?

I think the 330 is the better call.  You really don't want a BMW as a family
car anyway until the kids are much older.  I don't know what the prices are
but the 330ic is pretty sweet.

Thanks for the advice.  Much appreciated.  We plan on test driving

I heard it's pretty sweet.  I have a feeling we're going to lean toward
the 330i just b/c everything I've read rates it the best in its class.
I feel like the 5 series will be too big for us right now (w/o kids) but
we should get a better feel this weekend.  I'll keep you informed.

Thanks again.

Subject: RE: 


Drive 'em both, but at least for the older one's the 8 cyl was MUCH
smoother.  It really comes down to what you want.   Unless you're really
pushing it you won't notice much of a difference.  However, what you
will
notice is that the 6cyl will be working a lot harder (i.e. louder).
Once
you jump into the 5 you're in the luxury market and you probably want a
smoother car with plenty of torque (8 cyl).  Especially the way you
drive
(not winding the engine out in every gear) you'll feel more low end
power in
the 540.  Again, it comes down to the pax.  If you're hauling 2 most of
the
time, the 530 is probably fine;. hauling 4 it will be sucking wind a
bit.
Remember when you're on a test drive the car isn't configured the way it
will be in real life.  The tires will be under inflated, the gas tank
(large
in that car, like 14 gal ~90 pounds) and no passengers so your
performance
will seem better.  My best advice when looking at cars in that price
range
is to insist on an extended (overnight or over a weekend) test drive of
both.  You don't want to buy and wish you had bought the other a couple
of
weeks later.  Finally, think about long term (kids, etc) if you plan on
hanging onto it as long as the Miata.  It's not uncommon for a bimmer to
go
2-300,000 miles without engine work so you can hang onto them for quite
a
while if you stay up on the maintenance.  Give me a buzz at home
(301.737.5366) tonight if you want to yap about it.

Kev,

Real quick on the cars.  The beamer is real tight in the back seat.
Think
about how often you might be hauling 3-4 people.  If you think it's a
factor, spend some time on an extended test drive sitting in the back.
I'd
still look at the Vovlvo S-60 twin turbo, it might surprise you.

I was at the game last night sitting in home run territory - section
154.
It was one of the most disappointing games i've ever attended.  the
astros
don't even deserve to make the playoffs after their cowardly play.  the 
manager's an idiot - intentionally walking Bonds with guys on 1st and
2nd
with 2 outs.

Anyway, in terms of the Miata, the dealer recommended abt $1300 worth of
work.
Of course i told him to just get the thing running ($450).  The problem
is
the blue book value is only $2500 so i can't see putting another grand
into it.
I'll probably just sell it to someone who races miata's (which is really
big
in Texas) or donate it to charity and take the tax write off.

We haven't test driven anything yet but it looks like we're leaning
toward the
BMW 330i.  It seems to get great reviews, the main downside is that it's
a little
small - but still sporty.  We'll go for test drives this weekend and
should buy
or lease (still undecided) something in the next couple weeks.

How's everything on your front.  Less classroom time and more flying
time???

That faggot Lowery was in Austin this past weekend.  I don't expect him
to call
of course but it shows how easily he could've gotten to Houston while he
was 
working for 8 mos. in Dallas.

Later,

Sorry to hear about the turbo Miata.  What happened to it?  Can't it be
fixed or are you just abandoning it?  Where are you leaning in terms of
a
new car?  On my end, the classic motorcycle is buzzing like  a champ and
a

Do you have T.J.'s new email address.  I want to let him know I

My miata broke down this past weekend.  I didn't think it would be
that soon.  It looks like I'm forced to buy a new car.  I'm not 
looking forward to the process although the internet should make
it less painful than it was 9.5 years ago.  Wow, I can't believe
I've owned the Miata for over 9 yrs.  

I'm going to see Bonds play on Wednesday night.  Hoping he'll be
going for the record that night (either a tie or to break it).  I
scored tix in section 154 - prime bonds territory.  Check out the
section on the Houston Astros website.

Talk to you soon.

Some idiot lost a pair of pliers so I have to wait around to go fly.  I
guess it's just as well, I'd hate to find them at 3,000'.

Sorry to hear about the turbo Miata.  What happened to it?  Can't it be
fixed or are you just abandoning it?  Where are you leaning in terms of a
new car?  On my end, the classic motorcycle is buzzing like  a champ and a
complete blast to drive.

What's with the faggot Astro's walking your boy?  At least he pocketed one
record.

I don't have TJ's email w/ me, but I'm sure he never expected you to
actually show up in the first place.

Conway,

Do you have T.J.'s new email address.  I want to let him know I
won't be out there in Oct.  Give me a shout.  How's everything going?

My miata broke down this past weekend.  I didn't think it would be
that soon.  It looks like I'm forced to buy a new car.  I'm not 
looking forward to the process although the internet should make
it less painful than it was 9.5 years ago.  Wow, I can't believe
I've owned the Miata for over 9 yrs.  

I'm going to see Bonds play on Wednesday night.  Hoping he'll be
going for the record that night (either a tie or to break it).  I
scored tix in section 154 - prime bonds territory.  Check out the
section on the Houston Astros website.

Talk to you soon.

Recently, I asked you to "Lay It On the Line" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.

First, let's take a look at the survey results.

In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation.

I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were:

1.	Stock price
2.	The PRC
3.	Employee/internal morale
4.	External reputation and image
5.	"Walking the talk" of integrity and respect
_________________________________________________________________________________________

II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.


	% of employees responding
	strongly agree/agree:
I am committed to staying at Enron.	64.1%
Enron is a company I would invest my money in.	60.1%
I am treated with respect.	60.0%
I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.	59.1%
I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.	54.7%
Enron truly encourages people to take risks.	47.5%
My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	46.6%
Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	41.6%

_________________________________________________________________________________________

III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.


	More	Same	Less	N/A

Self-serving	41.9%	38.6%	7.5%	12.0%	


_________________________________________________________________________________________
IV.  Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron.

1.	People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect):
---	talented
---	creative
---     learn from one another
2.	Culture and reputation:

---   ability to embrace change

3.	Work environment:

---   true meritocracy
---   unlimited opportunities

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A "meltdown" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

Get ready.  Beginning in November, electronic pay stubs will be available to all employees who have their paychecks direct deposited into their bank account.  Electronic pay stubs are an easy, fast, and efficient way for you to get your payroll information.  They will also help Enron to realize a considerable savings in time and dollars spent over traditional printed pay stubs.

If you prefer to receive a hardcopy of your pay stub, click on the link below to complete a request form.  This form must be submitted to Payroll by October 15, 2001.  Unless you submit a form your pay stub information will default to electronic viewing.

As the November elections approach, I encourage everyone to exercise your right to be heard and to make a difference through your vote.  To do so, you'll need to have a valid voter's registration.  If you do need to register, please visit your county's website or call your county election officials to learn the procedures and timing.

For Houston-based employees:
The deadline for voter registration in Texas is October 9.  Voter registration forms are available at the InfoZone in the lobby, but if you choose to mail your form please allow enough time for the postal service to deliver your form.  See the following list if you need to obtain election information pertaining to Harris and surrounding counties.

Everyone, 

Once again, there are a number of new viruses that have been released on the internet that are causing us to do frequent updates to our virus protection software.  

We have an automated process to update our workstations with the latest virus protection updates.   However, there may be some machines that didn't get the update.  In order to prevent these viruses from infecting your machine, please assist by doing one of the following tasks. 

1.  Logout of the network and log back in or
2.  Click on START>PROGRAMS>ACCESSORIES>Norton AntiVirus Corporate Edition and then click the Live Update button.  This will pop up a screen where you will have to click the "Next" button and then a "Finish" button.   (If you are an EES user, you will only be able to use option #1 as you use a different virus protection product.)     

The proper version of the update pattern you need is:   (9/24/2001, version 30924p)

If you have questions or concerns, please direct them to your Resolution Center.

Enron Global Technology

There are several new computer viruses that are spreading rapidly on the internet.  The viruses target Windows computer users and arrives in e-mails with various subject lines like "Fwd:Peace BeTweeN AmeriCa and IsLaM!" The messages also contain attachments that can be directly executed by clicking on the attachment.  The most prevalent virus has an attachment named wtc.exe. 

If you ever get an email with an attachment that has an executable file, you should never launch the attachment.  At Enron, these file types are blocked automatically from entering our environment.  However, if you would connect to an external email service (i.e. Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo, etc) while using an Enron computer or attached to the Enron network, you could infect our internal computing systems.  If you do, the virus could cause significant issues and prevent some of our systems from working effectively.

If you ever get an email that you are not sure about, simply delete the email and contact your resolution center to let them know how you obtained the message.  It is much better to be safe than sorry as we will be able to track down the origin of the virus in the Enron Network.

Thank you.
Enron Global Technology

Folks,

Some of you were looking for a list of who's coming.  Shown below is a
headcount that should be fairly up to date and includes people who signed up
for either the Class Dinner, Class BBQ or Golf Tourney or some combination
thereof.  If you know some folks who are missing from this list it would be
a good idea to get ahold of them asap as we haven't received payment for any
events!

For last minute signups please call the Alumni Office (310) 333-ALUM.  You
can also pay at the door for most of these events, but it is highly
advisable to let us know you plan to come!

Sincerely,
Steve Smith
On behalf of Pete, Lynne, Melissa and many Reunion Organizers

get those lists as well...

AP Camden,NJ: A terrorist cell has been broken up in Camden just east of
Philadelphia. Four of the members have been apprehended by the Camden
Police, with the fifth still at large. Arrested in the Camden sweep were
Bin Eatin, Bin Smokin, Bin Sleepin and Bin Drinkin. All are being held on
illegal immigration
charges. Police stated that they can find no one fitting the description of
the fifth cell member, Bin Workin, in the area. But Camden Police are
confident that anyone who resembles Bin Workin would be easy to spot in
Camden.

Chump,

I've been super busy the last two weeks.  The pace seems to be cyclical and
we are definitely in high gear right now.  I don't expect it to slack off
until the Thanksgiving break with another push coming just before Xmas.  The
good news is, I am a third of the way through.

Did you ever get a car?

Frank

PS  Did you see WVU put up 80 on RU?  They suck!

This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.

In preparation for the upcoming move to Enron Center South we are moving your Home Directories to a new trading cluster.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
This will occur for you this EVENING after 6PM.  
We will need to restart your computer in order to complete this action.  
Please log out or your computer by 6PM, if the machine is not logged off we will reboot the machine in order to complete these actions.  
Save your data before going home this evening.
If you have outstanding circumstances that we should address, please reply to this e-mail and we will change our schedule accordingly.



HERE ARE A FEW OF THE BENEFITS OF THIS ACTION:
Newer, more stable environment
More disk space available for common data
Faster network connections



HOW THIS WILL EFFECT YOU:
If you are a laptop user and have to work at home, you should save any work to your 'C:' drive on the laptop.  DO NOT use the "My Documents" folder.  When you return to work and reconnect to the network, any changes made to files/folders in the "My Documents" folder may be deleted from the laptop.
Laptops reconnecting to the network for the first time will receive a synchronization error. 



RESOLUTION:
Please call the Resolution Center (x3-1411) and they will correct the problem ASAP.
We will have additional Technicians available on the floor if the Resolution Center has any problems.

Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.

Subject:	Start time of ECS Migration

Good day all:

I am working to coordinate the weekend.  If you could tell me the time that we can start taking apart PC's and move.  You will need to speak with your managers and find the times that this will be possible.  The earlier the better, but we need to know a time.  You will need to notify everyone of when it will start so they can leave, if a few have to stay we can work around them, but if anyone needs to be here extremely late we will need to know.

Currently we have people starting from 2:30 to 6PM.


Let me know and thank you for all of the help.

Starting at 5pm today, the EGM Fundamentals sites will only be accessible to EGM employees.  Should anyone in the gas world wish to access the sites, an eRequest will need to be submitted for consideration.  Users can find EGM Fundamentals in eRequest by selecting Applications and then searching on EGM.  The second option, "egm Fundy Website Users" should be selected.

looks good.  Metz says it looks fine too.  You'll probably get more
questions about Pub Ventures than trading.

A lady named Susan Mills should be calling you either tonight or this
weekend at home.  She'll set up your interview.

Everything looks good from this end.

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.

NewPower to offer another pilot program to Houston employees


Free remote energy management solution helps you to manage rising energy bills.
NewPower is launching a revolutionary technology pilot to the first 500 people to sign up in the Houston area.  The NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution is a pilot program designed to give consumers control of their thermostat via the Internet.  The program will allow thermostats to be adjusted from anywhere, with any Internet-enabled device, including computers, web-enabled cell phones, palm OS devices, or pocket PCs.  Sears Home Central will install and service the Remote Energy Management Solution at no charge throughout the duration of the pilot program.  For a typical household, the three-month pilot could result in up to 10 percent to 15 percent utility bill savings, based on personal usage and the size of your home.  


Be among the first to participate absolutely free.
Enrollment with the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution pilot program starts May 14 and continues through the end of the month.  For more information about this offer, visit NewPower's table located in the Plaza of the Enron Building near the down escalator from 11:00 a.m. to 2 p.m. during the week of May 14.  To become a pilot participant you need only to be a homeowner in the Houston area and have Internet access.  You do not even have to be a NewPower electricity customer to participate.  For more information about NewPower Connections, send an e-mail to connections@newpower.com.


Disclaimers:
Any contract for goods or services that is entered into by an Enron employee with respect to the NewPower program shall be solely between NewPower and such employee.  Enron assumes no obligation on behalf of NewPower and makes no representations, warranties, or guaranties with respect to NewPower, any goods or services offered or provided by NewPower.

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

A few more important reminders...

Chairs:  Must be labeled for the move---use the wire tags included in your move packets.
Keyboards, mice:  ONLY label non-standard types (i.e. wireless mice/keyboards, special ergonomic keyboards); otherwise, do not label.
Phones:  Do not label these.  New phones will be at your workstations at Enron Center South.
Laptops, cell phones, palm pilots, etc.:  Be sure to remind your groups to take these home.  The move team will not be responsible for moving these over.  However, docking station, cradles, etc. should be labeled.  The move team will move these over and set them up for you.

Thanks again for all your hard work,
Christa

Subject:	Move Related Issues

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  Hopefully,  you and your groups are all progressing well in your preparations for the move this Friday. Please take the time to read the information contained in this message because most of the information contains reminders or FYI items and will be important to you and your group.  Please forward this to those in your group that may need this information.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 6 boxes per person.  You may call Facilities (3-6300) if you need to request additional boxes.

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       "Under Review for Further Downgrade"

-- Fitch at BBB-             "Evolving Status"

-- S&P at BBB-              "CreditWatch Negative"

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under "SEC Filings."

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=
us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =
Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Cop=
ies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will b=
e incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may als=
o be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations=
, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) =

ilding, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (=

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be consi=
dered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders i=
n connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their d=
irect or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are availab=

update.

?I could see the Twin Towers burning from my office window in 
Brooklyn.

?When I saw the second tower fall, all I could think of was my son 
in daycare a few blocks from there.  Fortunately, I found he was 
safe.  Our home is two blocks from Ground Zero.  We couldn?t get 
back in for five weeks.  The Red Cross was a safe haven.  When I 
talked about my fears and concerns, they listened.  I felt truly 
cared for.?

Pamela Weadick, New York City

September 11, 2001 forever changed the landscape of our country and 
the life of every American. We have never faced a disaster of this 
size, scope or intensity but we?re meeting the challenge. 
Conversely, we have never before received such overwhelming support 
from the public. Americans like you have responded with an 
outpouring of love, labor, blood and generosity. The American Red 
Cross depends solely on voluntary donations of time, money and 
blood. Without donations from you and others, we would not be able 
to carry out our humanitarian mission.

America has spoken loudly and clearly.  The Red Cross is honoring 
the national call for relief efforts to be directed solely toward 
the people affected by the September 11 tragedies.  The immediate 
and long-term needs of the people affected by the terrorist attacks 
are our highest priority.  We?re moving more money to the families 
of the dead and seriously injured victims quickly by extending our 
Family Gift Program to cover a full year of living expenses, 
providing additional payments for the next 6 months based on need.

25,000 families already have been directly helped by the American 
Red Cross. Through your support of our disaster response efforts, 
millions of meals have been served, tens of thousands of people have 
received mental health and grief counseling, and millions of dollars 
have been dispensed to families in dire need to cover costs of 
transportation, childcare, mortgage or rent payments, funerals and 
related expenses. Thousands of people have been displaced from their 
homes, and the Red Cross is there offering funds for groceries, 
lodging, clean-up and recovery. More than 45,000 Red Cross 
volunteers and disaster workers have worked at Ground Zero where 
they have been caring for construction workers, police, fire 
personnel and emergency medical technicians.

The American Red Cross will spend $275 million in support of people 
affected by the disasters by year end, about half of the $542 
million that has been received to date.  We continue to assess the 
needs of those affected by these tragedies and will offer families 
even more assistance in the months ahead.

The Red Cross was the first organization to give such support and 
has provided more cash assistance to the families and dependents of 
loved ones lost in the September 11 attacks than all other major 
humanitarian service organizations combined. The Red Cross will help 
with recovery efforts throughout the weeks, months and years to come 
? for as long as needs exist.

Thank you for your trust and support. Together, we can save a life.

Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An "Alliance MX turret quick reference guide" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as "Caller ID" and "Voicemail Indication".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network "in-building" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible "Plug n Play" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Kevin,

This has to be one of the *ugly* games of the year.  The only saving
grace (and it isn't much of one either) is that the winner gets to say
they won their last game.  For Cal, that would be their only win.  I'm
going to be in OC at my in-laws, and I'm going to try to get an Internet
broadcast.

If Rutgers wins, I'll buy you a drink the next time I see you (actually
I'll buy you a drink regardless).  

Hi to Lisa - hope you guys have a Happy Thanksgiving.

Justin,

This is Garrett on the Ontario Power Desk.  I will be in the Houston office spending time with the East Power Desk next week.  Let's set up a time for you to run through your Ontario Gas burn model.  Farouk and I do not need a great deal of specific information,  just enough to identify when Lennox is burning gas, and approximately how much.  Monday and Tuesday afternoon are good times for me, reply when you are available.

Garrett

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Subject:	Logistics Commercial Realignment


After a careful review of the wholesale and retail gas trading and scheduling process it has been decided that the Gas Logistics teams should report directly into the Enron America's Commercial organization. This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows:

Wholesale

Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. 

Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help  maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. 

Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively.

Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby.

Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin 

George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta.  

Retail 

Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team.  


Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas.

 *  *  *  *  *    NOTE:  PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING...   *  *  *  *  *


With ECS (Enron Center South) rapidly approaching completion, Enron is forced to change the numbering scheme on the existing Stentofon system.  To increase our capacity to support this expansion, we must increase the number of valid Stentofon address numbers.  Enron currently uses 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 and 900 series numbers for the addresses.  In order to add more addresses to the system, Enron will be converting the dial plan from a three digit dialing system to a four digit dialing scheme on the Stentofon system.  This conversion is scheduled to occur on the weekend of May 18th.

In efforts to minimize the number of times each user will change their number, we will be converting all Stentofon addresses in EB1 that are scheduled to move into ESC this year to a 5000 series number.    (i.e.  If your Stento number was 364, then your new number will be 5364.)  We will also change all speed dials to reflect the new dialing scheme.  Please instruct the users within your group of this change.

All Enron Broadband Stentofons will have their numbers changed to a 4000 series number.  (i.e.  If your Stento number was 576, then your new number will be 4576.)  

In summary, all Stentofon numbers will be changing this weekend.  If you are scheduled to move into ECS, then your Stento number will begin with a '5' and if you are to remain at EB1, then your Stento number will begin with a '4'.

Please inform all users of the Stentofon System of this change and pass this information to anyone that needs it.


Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Stacy,

Kevin Ruscitti has requested a secondary firm ANR ML7 phy gas product for EOL.  I have located some language that you and Dale worked on back in May of 2000.  Please let me know if this language will be OK for our needs.  Also, will the current GTC for Phy gas need to be revised in any way?

Thanks,

In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, *.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.

We have taken these measures to protect our e-mail environment from harmful e-mail viruses. We believe that these protections will result in less down time for your e-mail, in the event that Enron gets hit with a virus or malicious code.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

	Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based Employee Referral Program.

	This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results. 

	There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.

	So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.

	Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

	David Oxley

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.

How did the move go?  Everything inside the four walls?

No, I haven't called Kampy yet.  It's been a mess at work and we've been in
Southern California seeing family the last two weekends.  I just had 3 hours
of training postponed, so maybe I'll get to it today.  The job search is
plodding along.  I've sent out my resume to a lot of places, both for inv.
mgmt. and for Treasury jobs, and I haven't gotten much response.  The
Treasury jobs all want 5 years or more of experience, which I think is a
joke, but maybe they're getting applicants who qualify.  It sounds like we
might have two potential buyers for this company - a change of
ownership/leadership might kill some of the uncertainty.  I don't think I'd
hang around here long-term, but anything that adds some stability is a good
thing.

I think the guy's name was Chris Sevrens.  I knew him vaguely; nice guy, but
one of the I-bankers who was in grad school because he had to be and never
seemed to take it very seriously.  Of course, I probably took it way too
seriously, so what the heck.

We've been out of town (first communion for our niece and a long-overdue
trip to see my mom) the last two weekends so we'll be laying low.  Some
yardwork, some chores, maybe a trip to the beach (11 miles to Half Moon Bay
- can't beat it).  I don't know if I mentioned it, but last summer I read
Kerouac's "Big Sur", which is the last book with the Dean Moriarty group.

I saw that, unbelievable huh?  The sad thing is that the folks I work with
never heard of Jack Kerouac nor "On the Road".
Probably not surprising considering most are from Texas.  How's everything
going?  Did you get an opportunity to call
Kampy.  How's the job search progressing?

Before I forget, was there a guy in our MBA class named Chris Sevrson or
something like that?  An email was forwarded
to me and that name was on the forward list and it sounded familiar.

Any big plans for the weekend?  We're just hanging around Houston.  It
seems every weekend for the past year+ we've
been doing some type of house work.  Hopefully one day it will slow.  Talk
to you soon.

Kevin

   By the way, did  you see the original manuscript for Jack Kerouac's
   classic novel of the beat  generation went for $2.2 million?  Maybe Lisa

   As I watched the Lakers pound that Texas  team?oh yeah, San Antonio, I
   was thinking about the guy Mr. Ruscitti refers to  as "my boy."  As I'm
   sure you were  both otherwise occupied, you probably missed my boy in
   action this  afternoon.  He was on what he  termed a "power walk
   (catchy, don't you think?)," going door to door with  power-saving light
   bulbs, which he was handing out free of charge to  "emphasize our need
   to conserve energy."   Boy, my boy is one powerhouse.   You think we
   could bottle what he's  got?

Stacy,

Kevin Ruscitti has requested a secondary firm ANR ML7 phy gas product for EOL.  I have located some language that you and Dale worked on back in May of 2000.  Please let me know if this language will be OK for our needs.  Also, will the current GTC for Phy gas need to be revised in any way?

Thanks,

CW

Hi Everyone...

1)  The forecast pattern seems very similar to what we've been talking about over the past several days.  6-10 features below normal in the Midwest and the East with a brief normalization possible toward the Great Lakes next weekend (days 8 and 9) before more cool air arrives.  11-15 indicates yet another trough digging into the East (temperatures normal to below normal) with the primary ridge remaining in the Southwest (above to much above).

2) 1-5 Day forecast also looks similar still quite cool for the East and Midwest - though not quite as hot for the immediate West Coast.  Above to much above normal temperatures will be common across interior California for most of the week with a 1 to 2 day spike of warm temperatures near the coast mid-week.  No prolonged period of heat will affect the Northwest.  

3) EarthSat will issue an "official" 6-10 and 11-15 forecast around 2pm today.  You can get this map by going to:  http://www.earthsat.com/misc/enron/   and then follow the "Sunday Update" link (near the bottom).  Login is "enron", Password is "enron".

Maps are attached - this is the way we feel things will look to start the day tomorrow.  *If there are any changes to this picture - it may be to warm the Midwest/ East closer to normal.  Right now this solution appears unlikely - but if there are any surprises tomorrow - it may be a SLIGHTLY warmer picture for the East.*  

 
Enjoy the rest of your weekend...

TEXAS GETS CAUGHT UP IN A POWER PLAY /Energy Alley to blame for California's woes? 

By ANN HODGES, Houston Chronicle TV Critic
Staff



Frontline joins hands with the New York Times tonight, to jump into what California Gov. Gray Davis has turned into a marathon news blast at Texas, and at Houston, over his state's energy woes. 

Frontline : Blackout, airing at 10 tonight, should have Davis and his bash-Texas troops giving each other high fives. 

In its opening minutes, Frontline 's narration sets a tone for Texas-bashing: 

"Investigators (otherwise unidentified) claim that a handful of energy companies siphoned billions from consumers while the lights (in California) were out. 

"If you want to understand the story of electric power in America today, you have to follow the electrons and follow the money. It's a story that starts here, in Houston, Texas." 

The blame game is in high gear, as Frontline 's dust-up hovers over Houston. 

Houston's Energy Alley, home of "electric cowboys" (Frontline 's words), is the focus of this "follow-the-money" trail. 

And Ken Lay, chairman of Enron, "the 800-pound gorilla" in the Alley, gets the major grilling in its high-powered interview hot seat, along with Enron CEO Jeff Skilling. 

Interviewees also include Vice President Dick Cheney, California and federal officials, other company executives, industry insiders and what Frontline calls "whistle-blowers." 

Politics and finger-pointing fuel charges and countercharges, with Frontline correspondent and New York Times contributor Lowell Bergman conducting the interviews, and an off-camera narration spinning the sound and fury. 

With blackouts expected to hit New York this summer, "the entire country will soon be short on power," Frontline asserts to set the stage. 

"The generators have made more money than God. I mean, they've made 7, 8, 900 percent profit," Davis charges. 

"Now that a fellow Texan sits in the White House," Frontline says, "the companies on Energy Alley are hoping things will only get better. . . . Lay is a personal friend and big backer of President Bush, and he and his executives have been the Bush family's most generous contributors. . . . " 

"There are a few of us that are still maybe idealistic enough to think that we can kind of support a candidate because we really believe in the individual," Lay counters. "We believe in their policies. We believe in the direction they are going to take the country." 

El Paso Corp., the largest natural gas company, gets its lumps, too, from California officials. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) was ready to dismiss California's complaint of price manipulation at the state's borders, Frontline says, "until Frontline and the New York Times obtained sealed documents revealing discussions at El Paso's highest levels." 

"Those documents are irrelevant," El Paso spokeswoman Peggy Heeg says. 

Frontline passes its golden opportunity to lay out, clearly and concisely, both sides - what critics say are the self-inflicted origins of California's energy crisis, and California's charges of price-gouging and pleas for price caps. Instead, that information comes piecemeal, over the course of contentious and often-confusing exchanges. 

To avoid retreat on deregulation, now in progress in 24 states, companies have begun to raise the possibility of settlement with California, Frontline reports. In Lay's opinion, "It's still going to take a comprehensive settlement of the whole issue, all the issues" - including money. 

Give Frontline full credit for stepping in where no other TV news outlet has dared to tread in such depth. Something is surely better than nothing. 

But this Frontline /New York Times team coverage effort does not cool the blame game. It sheds more heat than light. 

Frontline : Blackout, 10 tonight, 9 p.m. June 12 on Channel 8. Grade: B.

Class of '96,

Well the big 5-year reunion is final upon us!  Events start this Friday and
we are looking forward to seeing you in LA!  We have heard from just about
everyone regarding your attendance, and are pleased to hear that we will
have such a great turn-out!  Should be an awesome weekend  --  if you
haven't responded yet, please let us know your plans!

The last thing we need to do this week is get everyone to Register and pay
for the events you plan to attend -- this is important for several obvious
reasons, but first-and-foremost so that the event organizers can get a
proper headcount for buying food, drinks, name tags, and the works!  Please
register ASAP if you haven't done so already...

You can register in one of three ways:

1)  Online Registration - available until ***Wed, Oct 31st*** - go to
http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/alumni/
2)  Phone-in Registration - call 1-800-333-ALUM -- this option will be
available until ***Thurs, Nov 1st***
3)  Walk-up Registration - not the preferred method, but we always want you
there -- so worst case you can still sign up at the gate for most events!

Note:  You may still be able to mail in your registration, but it may not
arrive in time so best to use one of these methods...

Looking forward to seeing you this weekend!    Let me/us know if any
questions!

Sincerely,
Steve Smith
On behalf of Pete, Lynne, Melissa and many Reunion Organizers

You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm
Location: 	EB5C2
Presenter: 	Alex Huang


Registration is required for a head count.

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

Dear Alumni,

Please see opportunity for Investment Banking Associate
with the Denver office of Tucker Anthony Sutro Capital
Markets.  Please respond to contact information found below
job description.

Thank you,
Lorie


=============================

Investment Banking Associate
The Denver office of Tucker Anthony Sutro Capital Markets
("TASCM") is currently recruiting a first or second year
Investment Banking Associate for a full-time position based
in Denver, Colorado.


Job Description

Investment Banking Associates assume immediate
responsibility by working on a broad array of transactions
with a variety of TASCM professionals.  Associates are
exposed to various functional areas of corporate finance as
well as to all Managing Directors in their office or
region.  TASCM Associates are integrally involved in the
preparation of client presentations and transaction
execution.  Successful Associates create, manage and teach
complex, interrelated financial concepts, financial models
and business models.
As they mature, Associates will continue receiving exposure
oriented towards rounding out their transactional and
industry experiences.  Associates generally will be
assigned to one or more industry verticals or product teams
on a priority, but not exclusive basis.  They should be
conversant in all areas of corporate finance, require
minimal guidance in executing assignments to which they
have had previous exposure, and be capable of assembling
flawless client/prospect presentations.  TASCM Associates
are assessed in terms of ability to understand new
concepts, to work effectively on several assignments
simultaneously and to execute high quantities of quality
work.
Associates typically enter the organization with a MBA or
other advanced degree.  Prospective applicants for an
Associate position should possess a strong desire to become
an investment banker and understand the challenges of the
job and its commitments.  Our Associates typically have a
strong background, either through undergraduate study or
career experience, in finance and accounting.  We prefer
individuals with prior investment banking or deal
experience.  All candidates should possess highly developed
communication and client management skills.
The most critical qualifications for a successful career as
an Associate at TASCM are the desire and ability to thrive
in an entrepreneurial environment.  Our client roster
includes many early stage companies working at the cutting
edge of technology and business innovation.  We seek
individuals who think like business owners and embrace the
challenges and opportunities of working on the frontier of
the new economy.
Finally, we look to hire Associates who possess the
intangible leadership skills, character, integrity and
vision required to lead TASCM into the new century.  We
assess every potential candidate both on ability to handle
the responsibilities of the Associate position and
potential to become a Managing Director.

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Matt or Frank,

Please provide a sigma factor for the following product type requested by Kevin Ruscitti:

US Gas Phy Fwd Secondary Firm

A US gas transaction with Enron North America Corp., under which Seller shall sell and Buyer shall purchase a quantity of natural gas equal to the Daily Contract Quantity at the Contract Price on a Secondary Firm basis.  The Contract Price shall be as submitted by Counterparty via the Website.  The Period of Delivery shall be from the Effective Date through the Termination Date.
The term of the Transaction shall be from the Effective Date to the Termination Date. The Effective Date is 01 May 2001. The Termination Date is 31 May 2001.
The Transaction is for delivery at an ANR Pipeline Company ML7 interconnect.  The Purchaser will determine at what ML7 interconnect to take delivery.  The volumes Delivered by the Seller are subject to reductions due to operational constraints on the ANR Pipeline system. In the event that scheduled volumes are reduced due to pipeline operational constraints, Buyer will designate an alternate ML7 delivery location until an unconstrained point is designated.  In the event that the Buyer cannot take receipt at an alternative ML7 point, the Buyer must arrange for the gas to be delivered off-system, stored or parked at the Buyer's expense. These reductions due to Pipeline System constraints are not considered a failure to perform by the Purchaser.
The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the Contractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be millions of British thermal units and the quantity shown shall be in millions of BTUs per day.

 


Thanks,

CW

Nelson,
As you know, Grand Cheniere was under maintenance in October and we had to 
shut in Johson Bayou.   Francis wants us to reallocate (trespass gas) that 
they continued to flow onto ANR in the amout of  54,536mm to us  at an agreed 
upon price of $5.20.   ANR has agreed to do this next week.  Since you are 
out today Francis asked us to make sure you called him about this as well as 
another issue.  
Mark

Subject: I'll keep taking punches until their will grows  tired.

In 1974 the S&P 500 dropped 27% AFTER the first  rate cut by the fed.? In 
1981 it dropped 15% AFTER the first rate cut by  the fed.? With a S&P 500 
still trading at twice it's growth rate, 20 vs  10, a NASDAQ still trading at 
70 times earings, and a bullish advisor sentiment  still at 55%, the backdrop 
for a sharp rally isn't very good.? In a slowing  earnings enviroment I 
believe investors should focus on two sectors.? The  first are companies like 
Tootsie Roll Industries that manage to grow earnings  like clockwork.? 
Secondly, telecom/tech companies that are trading at their  growth rate and 
there is some assurrance that their customers are in a position  to keep 
ordering and paying for products.? For Tootsie Roll Industries it  is easy 
since the end user is the consumer and this products' consumption is  fairly 
recession proof.?? Efficient Networks' customers are SBC  Communications and 
others who then install their products to offer their  customer price savings 
that justify their capital investment. As long as SBC's  is financially 
strong and their ROI warrants the investment, the Efficient's of  the world 
appear to be interesting ideas.?  


? There will be layoffs not just in the DOT com world, probably everybody  at 
AMAZON, but also certain industries like the Financials and Auto's.?  This 
should remove once and for all any last Greenspan' fears of a wage led  
inflationary revival.? His comments yesterday were an admittance that this  
economy is softer than 14 feet of fresh powder in Montana.? Housing prices  
and financial assets were simply too inflated in general.? That doesn't  mean 
there aren't some good real estate markets and it doesn't mean there aren't  
any fair priced companies.

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Mark Frevert and Mark Haedicke

 ANR-OK 41,933 Dth/day

We are meeting with John Lavorato at 9:30 this morning to talk about hedging
the power side of this transaction.  Besides the gas bid we talked about 
yesterday,
please come up with a back-up plan to price the gas on a fixed price basis 
just
in case it takes us another day to address any other concerns that John may 
have.

Thanks,
Ruth

Subject: Procedures for Incremental Empire Gas for On-Peak Day Ahead Market

Marty suggested that I get these discussions kicked off on your side while he 
was
out-of-town today.  Basically, I started off with your proposed procedures 
and made
a few changes that Enron needs to make sure that right amount of gas shows up 
at the
correct time.

Also, we are suggesting a confirmation form be sent back and forth between 
Enron and
Sithe every day.  This will help document all the small little details and 
costs so that we
both drop anything through the cracks.  I am suggesting that we e-mail this 
confirm form
to the right folks in both our companies, so that no one is left out of the 
loop.

You will also notice our attempt to make sure that everyone has a clear 
understanding
of exactly what is included in the numbers that are reported to Enron's 
traders.  The timing
of your calls will be when everyone is very busy in our trading group.  There 
will not be much
time to have long conversations, but it is very important that everyone have 
the same
understanding what the numbers mean.

Please take a look at this on your side and see if there are some other 
things that need to
be included.

Thanks,

Ruth

Pilot 2 Participants!

Thanks again for participating in ClickAtHome's Pilot study.  We are very 
anxious to get started and are so excited to bring this incredible benefit to

time to further integrate with our vendor websites and are expanding the 
vendor offerings to bring broadband coverage to more employees.  We 
anticipate ordering to begin in late December.  Please feel free to email us

the election




Looks like Maury and I will be moving back to Texas soon, based on the
following proposal....

Solution to the Election:

#1:  Al Gore becomes President of the United States (all 49
states).

#2:  George W. Bush becomes the President of The Republic of Texas.

Gore shouldn't mind as he said we were the worst state in the union
during the campaign.

So what does Texas have to survive as a Republic?:

NASA in Houston, Texas (we will control the space industry).

We refine over 85% of the gasoline in the United States (that is why
Houston has problems with the air quality).

Defense Industry (we have over 65% of it).  The term "Don't mess
with Texas," will take on new meaning.

Oil - we can supply all the oil the Republic of Texas will need for
the next 300 years.

Natural Gas-Again we have all we need (too bad about those northern
states). Al Gore will figure a way to keep Tipper and you warm....

Computer Industry-we currently lead the nation in producing computer
chips.
A small place named Texas Industries, Dell Computer, EDS, etc., etc.

Health Centers-We have the largest research centers for Cancer
research, the best burn centers, and other large health planning centers.


We have enough colleges to keep us going:  UT, Texas A&M, Rice,
University of Houston, SMU, Baylor, UNT, Texas Women's University, etc.

We have a ready supply of workers (just open the border when we need
some more) and our friends across the border will pour in by the
thousands.

We have control of the paper industry, plastics, insurance, etc.

This just names a few of the items that will keep the Republic of
Texas afloat.

Now to the rest of the United States under President Gore:

Since you won't have the refineries to get gas for your cars, only
President Gore will be able to drive around in his SUV which gets him
about 9  miles per gallon.  The rest of the United States will have to
walk or ride bikes.

You won't have any TV as the space center in Houston will cut off
your communications.

You won't have any natural gas to heat your homes but since Al's
promised global warming, I'm sure you won't get cold!

You won't need our computer chips since you won't have electricity
to power the computers.

So don't worry about us down here in Texas.  We will be OK.

David J. Robinson, D. Min.
President
Houston Graduate School of Theology

This is a message from Cindy Olson, Executive VP, Human Resource & Community 
Relations.

Please take a few minutes to complete the attached, very brief survey. Your 
input is important in helping determine future efforts in this vital area.

You have been randomly selected to participate in the second of an ongoing 
series of surveys that will be conducted to help us gauge how effectively we 
are leveraging diversity to enhance our organization.

As you know, Enron is engaged in a struggle to recruit and retain the quality 
of talent necessary to allow us to meet and beat our competition.  The 
business case for diversity is inarguable and we must step-up to the 
challenge of recruiting, developing and continually valuing an increasingly 
diverse workforce.  Such an effort requires that we look at diversity in a 
broader context that combines the different thoughts and ideas, life and work 
experiences, as well as skill sets of employees. It is this combination that 
will enable Enron to remain the leading innovator and one of the most admired 
companies in the world.

Thanks in advance for your cooperation and contribution.

IN SPORTS TODAY:

After failing to secure a win via a recount of points, the Tennessee Titans
(6-7) are now demanding to replay the final down of their recent 42-41 loss
to the Dallas Cowboys (7-6).  Titan team officials explained that Titan
fans
intended for the final down field goal attempt to be good, and that
replaying the down is therefore justified despite the ruling of officials
that the ball did not pass thru the uprights.  Titan team officials added
that the width of the uprights confused kicker Al DelGreco (17yrs - Auburn)
on the 19 yard attempt and that the uprights should be widened for a replay
of the down.  Cowboys team officials countered that DelGreco had seen the
uprights before the game and had not complained to the officials.  They
added that Cowboy kicker Tim Seder (R - Arkansas) successfully kicked thru
the same uprights during the game from distances of 47, 42 and 36 yards.

TEAM CARLTON MAILBOX : ATTENTION MIKE DENZEL

We have received your acceptance and you are confirmed for ClickAtHome Pilot 
2.

You will be notified with an e-mail by November 17th on how and when you can 
access the ordering web site. Ordering is not expected to
begin until December. 

As a pilot participant, you will be testing various aspects of this new 
program such as the program offerings, program communications, product and 
service ordering, vendor services and program support.  At this time, the 
pilot program is not intended to provide access to Enron's network for 
telework purposes.   If you need Enron access for business reasons, please 
continue to maintain your existing computer and connection for this purpose.  
 In advance, we appreciate your co-operation and patience under this pilot 
program.  

Employees will have great options under this program for computers, 
peripherals, and Internet connectivity.   Your personal selections will 
determine your out-of-pocket expense, if any.  By participating the Pilot, 
you are not obligated to order hardware or connectivity, but will be given 
the opportunity to review your options and associated prices.

We know you are interested in more details.  However, one of our primary 
Pilot objectives is to test the communication on our web site.  We would like 
you to review more details about program offerings and related out-of-pocket 
costs, if any, once the pilot web site is available.  After agreeing to the 
Pilot Participants Agreement and reviewing these materials on the web site, 
you may choose to defer ordering until the All Employee roll-out in early 
2001 if you wish.

Please send any questions to the clickathomepilot2@enron.com mailbox.

Thanks.

Kevin,
 As we discussed, here are the changes I feel need to be made to the form 
before Enron North America Corp.  can agree to use it.

1.  Change 1.1 to read as follows:  This Agreement shall be effective upon 
its execution and shall continue in full force and effect through December 
31, 2000.

2.  Change 3.1 to read as follows:  Upon not less than 36 hours advance 
notification by Vector, Seller shall be obligated to sell and deliver to 
Vector, and Vector shall be obligated to purchase and receive from Seller, at 
the time stipulated by Vector in the advance written notification, at a Point 
of Sale, a quantity of gas equal to Seller's PSQ for such Point of Sale, as

Dear Amazon Customer,

As someone who has purchased books about World War II and the men
and women who fought it, you might like to know about two recent

World War II Generation" and Andy Rooney's "My War." These two

at 40% off. You can order your copies by following the links below:

"Our Finest Hour"
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1883013984/
"Life" magazine boasted an uncommonly talented roster of writers

the images and reports that brought home to American readers the
horrors of that distant war, and also documents the efforts on the
home front. This selection of photographs and extended captions
from the pages of "Life" and other contemporary publications
gathers images that have become part of American iconography.

Andy Rooney's "My War"
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1586480103/
Andy Rooney's "My War," a fine and wholeheartedly irreverent memoir,
recounts his experiences as a correspondent for "Stars and Stripes,"
where he saw combat up-close while honing his craft alongside such
fellow chroniclers as Ernie Pyle and Bill Mauldin.

Hi,

	My name is Iris Mack.  Currently I work on Enron's Power Options Trading desk.  

	I am primarily responsible for building our business in long-term, derivatives structures/trades on multiple commodities and financials.  For example, we are exploring potential structures and trades which involve power, gas, crude oil, weather derivatives, metals, etc.  Some of the building blocks for these multi-commodity derivatives products may be found in the attached document.

 	We are looking to build this business via utilizing as many of Enron's internal resources as possible.  Hence, it would be most helpful to meet with the relevant individuals in Gas Trading who would be interested in the development of multi-commodity derivatives trades/structures which may used to develop customized risk management tools for our clients.
	
	Thank you in advance for your assistance.
    
Kind regards,
Iris Mack, MBA/PhD
Enron Power Options Trading Desk

Having seen the trouble with the votes in Florida, I think this new more
technical ballot will help in the next election or if a revote is ordered.

Hi Everyone,

I know that there is a whole bunch of you on the receiving end of this EMail
and we haven't seen or spoken to some in quite awhile but know this -- we are
thinking of you and your families!!  Our little (big?) Luke turned 4 months
today so I thought I would share some photos with all of you.  Although we 
have
been guilty of not staying in touch, I hope that the attached photos will 
allow
us to somewhat catch up with you.  It is certainly all about Luke on this end
of the line.  He is happy, healthy and so is Mom and Dad.  Here is hoping that
all is well on your end.  We hope to see everyone soon again some day but 
until
then we wish everyone all the best!

Love,

Todd, Rena, and Luke

My brother in law put together this program for a Curry Baby Pool.  Try
your
luck for valuable prizes!  I hope the person who guesses May 14, 7 pounds
and 12 hours wins!  The projected due date is May 21.

With the extension of the PRC to all organizations, questions have arisen=
=20
about the results of this process. This memo provides some details about th=
e=20
PRC process.

First some context:  The key to Enron=01,s success is the increasing qualit=
y and=20
dedication of our talent.  As we continue to attract and retain the very be=
st=20
people, we all have continued to raise the performance bar throughout the=
=20
organization.  At the core of our system are the following principles:

? Hire the best people.
? Provide challenging opportunities.
? Pay well =01( and pay for performance (with bonuses based on merit, not=
=20
entitlement).
? Evaluate performance through a rigorous review process.
? Provide clear feedback and direction to employees.

The PRC is a critical component of our performance management system.  The=
=20
PRC is built on this foundation:

? 360 degree performance feedback.
? Review by a broad group, not just the supervisor.
? A relative ranking of performance across Enron to determine promotions an=
d=20
to allocate bonus money.


In addition to understanding this broad philosophy, we all need to understa=
nd=20
the following details:

? Relative ranking.  Enron uses the descriptors =01&superior=018, =01&excel=
lent=018,=20
=01&strong=018, "satisfactory", =01&needs improvement=018, and =01&issues=
=018 to group all=20
employees.  This year, =01&relative to his/her peers=018 precedes each of t=
hese=20
descriptors. This qualifier confirms what we have done and will continue to=
=20
do in practice; that is, evaluate individual performers against their peers=
. =20
It is possible, therefore, for someone to perform at the same or higher lev=
el=20
compared to prior periods, yet receive a lower rating for the current perio=
d=20
if other employees=01, performance raised the bar.
? Teamwork.  A relative ranking may invite the view that for one employee t=
o=20
gain, others must suffer.  However, feedback is explicitly solicited on=20
teamwork when evaluating each individual=01,s performance.  Anyone who atte=
mpts=20
to gain by withholding information or refusing to collaborate with others i=
n=20
the organization will suffer in a relative ranking on this key performance=
=20
criterion.
? Preferred distribution. In large part, the quality of our workforce has=
=20
been driven by our willingness to make tough decisions. We have consistentl=
y=20
captured business opportunities and overcome obstacles because we have made=
=20
the choices that had to be made in order to constantly improve our employee=
=20
talent base. The preferred distribution (5% superior, 30% excellent, 30%=20
strong, 20% satisfactory, and 15% needs improvement or issues) forces PRC=
=20
committee members to identify those who must improve in order to remain at=
=20
Enron as well as to single out top talent for special recognition. There is=
=20
some flexibility in the system, but every organization must ultimately face=
=20
this difficult question: have we achieved the highest level of performance =
or=20
are there still improvements that must be made? Few, if any, organizations=
=20
adhere exactly to the preferred distribution. Rather, they exercise informe=
d=20
discretion in the individual categories and meet a distribution that reflec=
ts=20
their groups=01, overall effectiveness and need for improvement.
? Communicating Ratings. Everyone rated =01&satisfactory=018 or below shoul=
d know=20
his/her rating. Each organization has determined for itself whether to=20
communicate ratings of =01&strong=018 and above.  In all cases, employees w=
ill=20
receive feedback about their performance against expectations, areas of=20
success, and areas that need improvement.

We hope this answers most of your questions about the PRC process.  We woul=
d=20
like your feedback and ideas on how to improve the PRC process going=20
forward.  Therefore, we will be conducting an eSpeak in the near future, an=
d=20
there will be other methods we will create to let us know what you think.  =
In=20
the meantime, please feel free to consult with your HR Generalist if you ha=
ve=20
any immediate questions, comments, or concerns.

Kevin,

Siobhan let me know that she reached you last week.  Thanks for taking the
time to forward my credentials within Enron to their Wind operation.  I have
a resume and a general cover letter zipped to this email.

Just to let you know in case you speak with someone at Enron Wind, I sent a
"cold" resume about two weeks back for an opening in project sales/marketing
(Job codes 111363/111364).  They have many interesting projects on the table
and I am eager to talk with their recruiter about global openings.

Let me know if there is anything I must do to follow up or provide additional
information.  Thanks again for your help.

David

Subject: Comments concerning Line Pack Gas Purchase Agreement form provided 
by Vector.

Kevin,
 As we discussed, here are the changes I feel need to be made to the form 
before Enron North America Corp.  can agree to use it.

1.  Change 1.1 to read as follows:  This Agreement shall be effective upon 
its execution and shall continue in full force and effect through December 
31, 2000.

2.  Change 3.1 to read as follows:  Upon not less than 36 hours advance 
notification by Vector, Seller shall be obligated to sell and deliver to 
Vector, and Vector shall be obligated to purchase and receive from Seller, at 
the time stipulated by Vector in the advance written notification, at a Point 
of Sale, a quantity of gas equal to Seller's PSQ for such Point of Sale, as 
specified in Exhibit A to this Agreement.  The parties agree that time is of 
the essence in this Agreement..

3.  Add 4.2 to read as follows:  4.2  If Vector fails to purchase and receive 
from Seller the quantity of gas required to be purchased and received by it 
under Article 3.1 for any reason other than the occurrence of an event of 
Force Majeure, Vector shall indemnify Seller and shall be liable to pay 
Seller an amount equal to the difference between the price that would have 
been paid to Seller and the Gas Daily low price, set forth in Gas Daily under 
the heading "Daily Price Survey" under the listing applicable to Chicago and 
using the low price in the range of prices published for the day that Vector 
failed to perform multiplied by the volume Vector failed to purchase and 
receive from Seller for such day.

4.  Add the following language at the end of 9.1.  For breach of any 
provision for which an express remedy or measure of damages is herein 
provided, such express remedy or measure of damages shall be the sole and 
exclusive remedy hereunder.  If no remedy or measure of damages is expressly 
herein provided, the obligor's liability shall be limited to direct actual 
damages only, such direct actual damages shall be the sole and exclusive 
remedy hereunder and all other remedies or damages at law or in equity are 
waived.  Unless expressly herein provided, neither party shall be liable for 
consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or indirect damages, lost 
profits or other business interruption damages, in tort, contract, under any 
indemnity provision or otherwise.

5.  Add the following Seller's information in 10.1.
 Enron North America Corp.
 P. O. Box 4428
 Houston, Texas 77210-4428
 Attn:  Documentation and Deal Clearing Desk
 Facsimile No. (713) 646-4816.

Of course your Dad would be invited to anything we do, but if you'd rather 
spend the
time alone with him that weekend we could always make it another weekend.  
The only
problem with the 12th is that we'll be consumed with the move the entire 
weekend.  Let
me know what works for you.  We're flexible after the 12th.

Easter was great, how 'bout yours.  It was just me, Lisa and a friend of mine.
How's everything been with you?  How are the wedding plans coming?  Have
you seen Bruce lately?  How 'bout my brother?

I'll tell you what.  You give us your "want"  list and we'll make sure you

Of course, after you assemble the chair.

Stacy,

Kevin Ruscitti has requested a secondary firm ANR ML7 phy gas product for 
EOL.  I have located some language that you and Dale worked on back in May of 
2000.  Please let me know if this language will be OK for our needs.  Also, 
will the current GTC for Phy gas need to be revised in any way?

Thanks,

A US Gas Transaction with Enron North America Corp., under which Seller shall 
sell and Buyer shall purchase a quantity of natural gas equal to the Daily 
Contract Quantity at the Contract Price on a secondary firm basis. The 
Contract Price shall be as submitted by Counterparty via the Website.  The 
Period of Delivery shall be from the Effective Date through the Termination 
Date.
The term of the Transaction shall correspond to the date(s) set forth in the 
Product description on the Website.
The transaction is for delivery at the ANR Pipeline Company ML7 
interconnect.  The volumes scheduled to be delivered are subject to 
reductions due to normal operational constraints on the ANR  Pipeline Company 
pipelines based upon historical operating conditions.  The reductions caused 
by these constraints are excused nonperformance and are not considered a 
failure to receive or deliver firm gas.  In the event that the volumes 
scheduled are reduced due to such normal operational constraints, Buyer may 
designate a secondary firm delivery location.
The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the 
Contractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be millions of 
British thermal units and the quantity shown shall be in millions of BTUs per 
day.

Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

We'll just be doing some house shopping.  I think we're going to postpone the 
upgrade to
the existing house and look to buy a new house.  This would eliminate the 
need to move
out for 6 months.  I'm dying to live in a house that is complete.  Anyway, 
besides this we
don't seem to have much going on.  I'll just need to go into work for a few 
hours on Sunday.

Let me know what you want to do.

You're correct, Enron doesn't get too involved in these conventions.  I don't 
know 
why.  It seems that some of the desks have some functions but mine never 
does.   My desk
seems to be pretty apathetic (probably not a good thing).  I think we've 
relied, more than
any of our other desks, on the financial and e-commerce sides of the 
business.  Probably
not a great thing.  Anyway, lets get together for a cocktail or dinner 
sometime within the 
next month.  Did you guys move to the Galleria location yet.  Let me know - 
we'll go get 
a big steak at Morton's or Ruths' Chris.  I assume a country boy like you is 
into some
good red meat.

Stamos, 

Glad everyone had a good time at Sweets'.  I hope he had a blast.

In terms of your email reply,
you can have Calpine.  How are they going to make money long term if price 
caps are instituted?  This obviously would be the stupidest policy.  In 
addition
their exposure to the CA crisis must be pretty significant - when and how are 
they
going to get paid?  I wouldn't want to bank on the energy market in the most 
regulated state in the country.  Plus, if the state backs energy purchases, 
it's 
going to get to the point where who wants to own CA credit??  PG&E and Edison
International are doomed, as they should be.  The state of CA is going to go
down the tubes unless they find some good leadership.  Unfortunately, noone
out there seems to have the least clue on how to solve the problem.  The 
politicians
are a complete joke.  It is incredibly disheartening to witness the absolute 
stupidity
of the CA politicians in addressing this issue.  They seem to be much more 
focused 
on finger pointing than coming up with a viable solution.  I honestly think 
they are incable
of solving the problem.

Stamos,

I don't think many buying opportunities out there.   The economy is going to 
get 
crushed this year.  There's only one place to put one's money now, and that 
is in cash.
The manufacturing sector is in dire straits and you will continue to see an 
increase in
plant shutdowns and company layoffs.  The Fed could continue to lower rates 
but there'll
be little capital investment if consumer spending dries up.  I feel we've 
just seen the beginning.  
I think the Dow will be trading under 8000 by the end of April.

Psychologically, the California crisis will add to consumer fear.  The crisis 
is not a short term
problem.  As a result, barring any Federal bailout, you could kiss that 
state's economy goodbye.
Let me ask you a question; if you were paying (1) the highest real estate 
prices in the country, and 
(2) the highest energy prices for the least reliable power, in (3) the midst 
of a hi-tech meltdown, what would
keep you or your company from closing shop and moving to a different state??  
If you own any
CA real estate, sell.  The only way to solve the CA energy crisis is to 
reduce demand or increase supply.
Since CA doesn't want any power plants in its backyard, the supply issue 
likely won't be solved anytime
soon.  So, how do impact demand??  You have to price energy(power/gas) so 
high that
the discretionary user (household, manufacturer, commercial store) conserves 
by closing its plant, cutting
back on the thermastat or running the commercial operation during off-peak 
hours.  California will see
this reduction in demand over time.  If the blackouts subside it's because so 
many businesses have
closed their doors for good or moved to another state.  Without this, the 
blackouts will get much worse.
If the state tries to get into the business of buying and selling electricity 
and gas, I would bet it will go
bankrupt within 2-3 yrs.  Could you imagine the impact on the national 
economy from the bankruptcy 
of the U.S.'s most prosperous state.  Obviously this is only my opinion, but 
I would keep my eyes on
the energy markets - that's where the key to the turnaround lies.  Take Care 
and thanks for the email.

That state will never be the same.  My prediction is that the state will be
bankrupt within the next 2 years unless the Federal Gov't bails it out.  I 
hope
Lowery has held off on buying his house.

Talk to you this weekend.  I blew off the Montana trip so I'll be home.

Great to hear from you.  Looking forward to meeting in Houston for a baseball 
game.
Conway will be in Corpis soon so we should be able to do a weekend.  We 
should start
construction on the house in May - what an incredibly long process it is.  I 
definitely would
not do it if I had to do it over again.  One redeeming factor is that we 
bought on a good 
block.  We definitely have the ugliest house on the block.  We should get a 
pop in real
estate also when all the California companies start migrating to Texas.  

Joking aside, unless you guys have incredibly mild weather this summer 
combined with
a lot of rainfall, you're summer will suck.  There is no doubt that the CA 
economy is going
to suffer a great recession.  You have a shortage of supply so the only way 
to ease the
problem is to reduce demand.  This usually occurs when prices reach levels 
where the price
sensitive buyers cut back.  However, with your boy Grey Davis pushing for  
price caps, this won't
happen.   The next way for demand to be trimmed is for companies to leave, so 
this will probably
need to happen to an extent for the problem to ease.  The other factor, of 
course, is that you
could have an increase in supply - new power plants.  But being that the amt. 
of time it takes to 
develop and build a power plant in CA is about 3 times as long as in most 
other states combined
with the fact that CA hasn't had a new power plant in the last 10 years, an 
increase in supply
doesn't seem likely in the short term.  Again, this is only my opinion, so 
you could take it with
a grain of salt.  

Talk to you soon.

Kevin

BL,

Have you experienced any blackouts yet?  I think you'll see a lot this summer.
What does everyone think about the situation?  Do they think it's a threat or 
not?  I think
the state is in for a horrific summer - I hope it doesn't turn out that way, 
but it'll be incredibly
difficult to avoid.

Hope everything's going well with work and with the family.  When's the next 
time you'll
be in Dallas?  Let me know.

Jen,

Great to hear from you.  Early congrats on your graduation.  Everything has 
been
going well down in the Lone Star State.  I got married in September down the 
Jersey
shore and everything has been going well.  We bought a house back in May.  It 
needs
an incredible amount of work.  We own the ugliest house on the block, by far.

How are things in Indiana?  Are you and Paul still together?  How is he 
doing?  When
is the last time you were back in Jersey?  We went back over Christmas but 
only for
a couple days.  I think next year we'll go back during New Year's instead of 
Christmas.
If you ever get near Texas or pass through Houston, please give us a call.  
You both
are always welcome to stay at our house.  My phone # is (713) 880-4157.  My 
work
# is (713) 853-6320.  Hope to hear from you soon.

The following article appeared in today's Chronicle.



Jan. 25, 2001, 10:59PM

Enron rating setup irks many workers 
By L.M. SIXEL 

TONGUES ARE WAGGING at Enron Corp., and it's not because of the bonuses 
they're expecting next month. 

Employees are irate about a new performance-review ranking system that pits 
them against each other. 

Under the system, nicknamed "rank and yank," employees will be put in one of 
five categories: 5 percent will be identified as "superior," 30 percent will 
be labeled "excellent," 30 percent will be called "strong," 20 percent will 
be labeled "satisfactory" and 15 percent will be called "needs improvement" 
or "issues." 

An insider said "needs improvement" means "you have one leg hanging out the 
window." And "issues" is Enron lingo for "you're gone." 

The rankings, whose names reportedly took Enron officials hours to come up 
with, are not based just on performance. 

Instead, they compare employee against employee. 

"It is possible, therefore, for someone to perform at the same or higher 
level compared to prior periods, yet receive a lower rating for the current 
period if other employees' performance raised the bar," according to a memo 
from Chief of Staff Steven Kean and Executive Vice President Cindy Olson that 
was distributed this month. 

While employees are competing against each other for ratings, they're also 
expected to be team players, according to the memo. 


`Horse-trading' of rank denied
The problem, according to someone familiar with the new system, is the 
horse-trading that goes on when the rankings are divided up. 

Managers trade rankings like baseball cards, explained the insider, offering 
to downgrade one employee if they can get a better rating for another 
employee. 

An employee's ranking is more a function of the negotiating skills of the 
manager he is working for, the insider said. 

Olson, who's over human resources and community relations, said no 
horsetrading is going on. The rankings, due out this week, aren't set in 
stone, she said. Only 9 percent of employees were rated in the bottom 
category while 6 to 7 percent were labeled superior, she said. 

But Olson said she can see how employees might be worried about the prospect 
of bargaining. 

She speculated that one reason employees might worry is because it's a new 
system for about 60 percent of Enron's employees. In years past, only the 
wholesale energy services group was ranked this way. 

Some human resource managers expressed surprise that Enron, which is known 
for hiring superstars, apparently feels that it must get rid of so many 
employees -- or at least put them on notice that they're not doing well. 

It doesn't say much about the confidence of your recruiting system if you're 
getting rid of 10 to 15 percent of your work force each year, said a human 
resource manager in Houston who asked to remain anonymous. 


Some may not fit in
Some people, as smart and talented as they are, just don't fit into Enron's 
culture, Olson said. It's a company that doesn't tell people what to do; you 
have to know what adds value, she said. Some folks just have a hard time in 
that environment. 

After thinking about it for a moment, Olson added that maybe Enron's 
recruiters aren't doing a good enough job weeding out the people who wouldn't 
do well in an entrepreneurial environment. 

Forced ranking systems were popular several years ago. But they fell out of 
favor, in part because they were seen as damaging employee motivation. 

Several years ago, Houston Lighting & Power put in a forced ranking system, 
dividing all employees into four groups, with "1" the top group and "4" the 
lowest. Employees were so angry with the system that some work crews had 
T-shirts printed: "Don't ask me -- I'm a 3." 

Olson said she doesn't see a problem with motivation. People like to know how 
they stand and will work hard to reach the top category, she said. 

But many of the employees -- at least the ones who rate above satisfactory -- 
won't know how they're rated. Managers don't have to reveal the ratings. 

And as for figuring out what it takes to be superior? You've got to reinvent 
your job, add new business lines or create something totally new. 

"Employees understand that when it's explained to them," Olson said.

Correction,  I don't think thinks will blow over this summer, I think things 
could blow
up and actually be a lot worse than they are now.  In terms of longer term, I 
think
a lot depends on how the state tries to resolve the problem.  It will be 
interesting to
see.  I feel that the summer will be very interesting, especially if 
California gets the
kind of heat they had last summer.  Stay in touch.

The house thing is a tough call.  It's hard to say.   If you're not in any 
hurry to buy, the summer should give
you a good indication of continuing energy problems.  I personally think that 
the problem will come and go 
for a while, but a lot depends on how California's legislature deals with the 
situation.  I have no idea what 
they'll end up doing - they've acted pretty poorly already.

What's your time frame on a house?  If you're only concern is that prices are 
at their highest level in the last 
decade, I wouldn't worry too much about that.  It's impossible to time the 
market -  who would've thought 
San Francisco's housing prices would be at these current levels.   There are 
also a lot of intangibles associated 
with home ownership as your aware of.   

I would be concerned about the energy situation, so just try to keep abreast 
of it.  Also, you could call me if you
have any questions.  I'll try to help the best I can.  Take care and tell Kim 
and Kendall I said hi.

Kevin

Chump!
This energy crisis is making me question  my timing on buying a house.  I'm
thinking if the economy tanks the housing prices will dip a little.  They
just crack the highs of 1989 this last two years.  Any opinions?

I start my Texas travel in February.  I'll be in Dallas for the first full
week and back in March in Dallas again.  Starting the end of March I'll be
there almost every week for about 6 months.  You'll be seeing more of me than
you want.  When we get closer to March I'll give you a buzz to set up some
dates.
Sorry about the Kendall picture, I'll try again.

Take care, B

I thought I had your home phone #, but I only have your work #.  As a result,
I didn't call you this weekend.  Send me your home # so I can give you a ring.

By the way, Happy 35th birthday.  I hope you had a good one.

Kevin

Mr. B. Lowery,

First of all, you sent me a picture with the head cut off.  I couldn't even 
see Kendall.
I don't know if something happened with the translation of the file, but try 
to send
it again if you can.  

In regards to California's energy crisis, I think that California is screwed 
- big time.
I think it has the potential to cripple the state's economy.  If, like you 
said, noone 
really talks about it much in SoCal, I would bet that will change soon.  It 
has the potential
to affect every person in the state.  Not only will consumers end up bailing 
out the
utilities - SoCal Edison, San Diego, Gas and Electric, PG&E - but it will 
likely prevent
many new companies from setting up shop in California.  After all, who would 
want
to put millions of dollars in an operation that will be subject to power 
interruptions 
while paying the highest utility bills in the country.  I think that the only 
way California
will come out of this OK, is if it has the least energy intensive weather for 
the foreseeable
future.  I don't think this is a problem that will be resolved within the 
next couple years.
But remember, that is just my meaningless opinion.

When do you start coming to Texas.  Let me know so we can try to hook up.  
I'll talk to
you soon.

Bri,

What's the deal with this Gray Davis guy?  What's your opinion on him?
He's
pretty much out to lunch on this whole energy crisis thing.  I was
wondering how
the citizens of California viewed him.

Hope everything is going well with Kim, Kendall and yourself.  Talk to you
soon.
Send an updated picture if you have one.

713-880-4157.  I'll give you a call this weekend.  It's incredibly difficult 
for
me to talk at work so I'll give you a shout at home.   Talk to you soon.

Julie,

If they want to pay $5.15, that's fine with me.  I do have $5.11 in the 
system but I could
have easily made a mistake.  Let me know if you have any other questions.

Kevin

P.S.  Sorry it took me so long to reply.

If you could only own one stock what would it be?  For me it would be EOG 
Resources - don't

Counnnnnnnnn,

What's up?   I heard Conway emailed you the other day about New Orleans.  I'm 
going to 
meet Conway and Jughead in N.O. on Nov 17 - 19 for a weekend getaway.  I just 
booked
my flight a couple days ago and wanted to see if there was any way you could 
make it
down.  It seems Conway has gotten a cheap hotel room with his military 
discount - one of the
perks of working for Uncle Sam.  I'm sorry for the short notice but we just 
decided to do it a 
few days ago.  If you could make it, we'd all love to see you.  If not, we'll 
have to get together
when I'm in NJ over Christmas.  Tell Chris we said hi.  Hope everything is 
going great for the
both of you.  Talk to you soon.

Kevin

I get in at 4:45pm on Friday.  What time will you be in?  Do you want me to

Sorry it's taken me so long to reply, but I just checked my email.  We were 
out of town the
last few days.  It sounds like you've been doing a lot of thinking and 
reflecting.   I think it healthy
to analyze one's actions in order to better understand oneself.  This better 
understanding, I find,
typically leads to self improvement and greater control, and ultimately, more 
happiness in life.
However, do not let it lead to any form of regret - that would be unfair.  We 
all have regrets, but
these regretted actions typically make us stronger and better people in the 
long run.  

I forwarded your email to Patty Kampmann, not Patti Campi.  As you might 
imagine, I got a kick
out of that.

Talk to you soon.

Kevin

try to get in touch with
my friend today.  I've been out of town for the last few days.

Cherly,

I have been promoted out of the Associate program last PRC.  As a result, if 
you could take me off the Analyst/
Associate distribution list I'd deeply appreciate it.  Thanks and let me know 
if you have any questions or if you
haven't been notified of the promotion.

TJ,

Thanks for the congratulatory message you left on our voicemail - it made us 
feel great.
We actually didn't go on a honeymoon - we will take one sometime next year.  
We've just
been swamped with the house we recently bought.  We bought an old small 
bungalow
in the city.  What a money pit.  Hope everything is going great.  Tell 
everyone we said
hi.

Thanks again,

Kevin

The one thing I remember is that they are incredibly expensive and somewhat 
troublesome
to maintain.  Depending on how old it is, I definitely  wouldn't recommend it 
as your primary car.

Hope you had a good time at the wedding.  It was one of the best weekends 
I've had in ages.

Talk to you soon.

I appreciate the email.  I figured something must be wrong for you to miss 
the big day, but I was afraid to call.  The
important thing, obviously, is that you get better.  We'll just have to 
figure out a way to meet up with you in the near
future.  Tell everyone I said hi and keep me informed of your operation and 
recovery.  We'll all miss you very much.

Hugs and Kisses,

Kevin.

P.S.  Tell Tom and John we said hi.

Sounds great.  Moller's email address is Richard.J.Moller@marshmc.com.  I do 
not have anyone else's email,

ask him.  Let me know if you need anything
else.

Thanks,

Hey bro

What is happening?! Fishing stuff is coming along. The charter is set for
Sept. 22nd in the A.M. departing from point pleasant. Capt. Gene will get
back to me in a week or so with more details.

The cost is $50 per person. No bottles allowed but you can bring cans or
cups. I've got the beer and drinks. Also pack food. Trip should be about 8
hours.

Contacted Rich Moeller and let him know about the time and specifics. It
looks like 14 people are going with the possibility of about 20 (5 are still
undecided). Should be a good time.

If you have some e-mail addresses for Rich or Rosigliano or a couple of
other people please supply them to me so I can keep everyone posted on the
details.

The big date is less than 4 weeks away (Can you believe it?)

Hope all is well,

Keith

Please forward this on to Mike and Kevin.  The turnaround time is rather
quick so you probably should contact this person directly to tell him that
you will be coming and sending a check to the address referenced in the
invitation.  Just tell him that you received the invitation from Kara Kinder
Howes (my cousin) and David Kinder.  Kara is one of the hosts of the event.

Alberto,

You're best bet is to send a resume to Chris Gaskill.  Chris is starting a 
new fundamental analysis group.  I know he
is looking for a few more people to get this group off the ground.  If you're 
interested in trading, it's probably the best
way to get involved in this side of the business.  I'm not sure if you have a 
long term interest in trading or if you're just
looking for a rotation.  Give me a call also after 4pm and I could provide 
you with some insight into the area.

Until then send Chris an email with your resume attached or you could talk to 
me first if you'd like.

Kevin

Luke's growing like crazy.  Great to see the update.  Yeah,   the wedding is 
getting near and
the plans are pretty much complete.  We're really just having family so the 
plans at this point are minimum.

How's everything in California.  Is Lowery showing up on your doorstep every 
Sunday at dinner time?  I wouldn't
be surprised.

Did I tell you about the dinner I attended in NY a month ago.  What an 
event.  The party included - get this crew - 
Bill Ricigliano, Dan Sweetser, Jonathan Counnnn, Richie Moller, Brian Sh., 
and yes, Vincent Lima.  We were
all privey to Moller drinking a 12 oz. glass of fresh piss.  Some things 
never change.

Talk to you soon.

Good to hear from you.  The name of the jeweler is William Crescent and his 
phone
number is (708) 418-5075.  He is located in Lansing IL and his address is 
18049 Torrence Ave
Lansing, IL  60438

Let him know I recommended him and if he doesn't remember me tell him I was 
referred
by Greg Penmann and Mike Curry.  They both bought their engagement rings from 
Bill.

He's a pretty cool guy so just tell him what your looking for in terms of 
cut, clarity, color,
and carat.  He'll receive a number of stones that fit your description and 
describe them
over the phone.  He should encourage you to shop his prices.  I found him to 
be very
competitive.  Let me know how it goes.

Are you available to meet next Tuesday afternoon around 4pm.  Let me know.

Kevin

You're correct, I am saddened to see such a great x-Philly treated so 
poorly.  I often look back 
with wonder at how much ground Stocker would cover at the shortstop position, 
not to mention
his tremendous power for a man of such small stature.  He could only be 
compared to x-Philly
and future hall of famer - Ivan DeJesus.  The only uncertainty is whether or 
not Ivan will elect
to be inducted under the Philly or Cubs uniform.

On the house front,  we purchased one and moved in at the beginning of May.  
It's a fixer-upper.
All our weekends are spent working on it.

I gotta run, but thanks for the email.  Let me know how everything is going 
in your world.  Tell
Rina and the kids we said hi.

They appear to have made the changes that we requested.  Do you want me to 
fill in the name of the Seller and print off 2 originals for signature.  If 
not, please fill in the name and forward to me for initialling before the 
contract is signed by ENA..

Thanks for the picture.  I'm glad you guys like the gift.  Luke looks just

As far as Ricigs goes, I don't have his phone # or address.  I think Moller

Let me know  if you need his #.  Take care and tell Rena and Luke we said hi.

Kelly,

I spoke with my friend and he mentioned that Michael was already talking to 2 
firms and he
didn't want to recommend a third at this time.  I told him that if anything 
changes, let me know.
It was worth a try anyway.  I'll talk to you soon.

That would be great.  Let me know so I could get tix to a ballgame if the 
Astros are in town that weekend.
I'm going to the game next Monday to see McGwire and the Cards.  Glad to hear 
everything's going well.

I got a call from Peremes on Saturday.  She heard I got engaged and was 
pissed I didn't tell her.  I think she's
smoking serious crack 'cause I told her when I talked to her about 6 mos. 
ago.  I guess she just chose to ignore
me as usual.

Talk to you soon.

KR

P.S.  We just closed on a house this past Friday.  It's in need of some 
serious work.  Hopefully it'll be
habitable by the time you see it.

Chump,

Long time no hear.  Sorry it's taken me so long to touch base with you.  
Between work, the wedding,
and the fact that we just purchased a house (pending inspections) I've been 
pretty stressed.
As far as the wedding goes Lisa and I have decided to scale down 
considerably.  We're only going
to have immediately family and the folks in the wedding party.  For me that 
includes you of course, Moller,
Kampy and Peremes (even though she won't be in the wedding).  Don't tell her 
though, she's the only
one I haven't mentioned anything to.  I'll make sure you and Moller get to 
share a room.  I feel kinda bad
about not inviting Lowery since I was in his wedding, but I don't feel like 
dealing with Kim.  She's really 
annoyed me the last few times I've seen her.

We still plan on having it at the B&B in Long Beach Island.  We'll have a 
catered dinner for about 45 folks.
It should be more manageable and cheaper this way.

Do you have the exact date when you'll move back to the states?  I'm psyched 
you'll be a lot closer.  You
could swing over to Houston and check out the new house.  By that time we 
should have it in decent shape.
We bought the ugliest, most beat-up house on the block.  It definitely needs 
a lot of work.  We'll be busy for
the next year working on it.  I think when it's done,  it'll look pretty cool.

Anyway,  send me an email and let me know how everything's going and when 
you'll be back.  Take care and
tell Marie we said hi.

Congrats Murli,

Sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you.  I'm glad you accepted a job 
at Enron.
I know you'll enjoy it.  As far as ECI goes, what group is this?  Is this the 
Communications
group?  I would not recommend EES however.  I think you're experience would 
be better
at ECT (now ENA) or Enron Communications.   Give me a call at 713-853-6320 
(W) and
we can talk.  Also I'm still in an apt so I don't know any real estate 
brokers to refer you to.

Talk to you soon.

Kevin

Dave,

It was great getting a chance to finanlly meet the other night.  Hope you 
enjoyed dinner.

Since then, I've been thinking abt some of our conversation re: the PBR.  I 
have a quick
question - why wouldn't you under withdraw in Feb and over withdraw in Mar if 
Mar is currently
higher than Feb.  You could lock this in by buying Mar forward.  Also,  what 
happens if you
withdraw in Mar and the Summer peaks higher than what you withdrew at?  How 
is this accounted
for?

I'll talk to you after you get back from Houston.

Kevin

I couldn't be happier for you two.  How's Rena feeling - probably relieved, 
huh?
Thanks for the call with the news.  We were out for the day, that's why 
didn't get back

P.S.  Great Name

Great to hear from you.  Things have been going well in Houston.  Lisa is 
working for Johnson Controls.
It must be a long time since we've talked b/c she's been with Johnson for 
about 5 months.  I love my
new job - I'm trading gas up in the Midwest market area - Illinois and 
Michigan.  Things have been 
incredibly busy.

The wedding plans have changed considerably.  As I'm sure you can relate to, 
the stress of planning 
combined with the input of so many others have made us decide to have a 
wedding with only our folks 
there and not even have a reception.   We figured we could put the money 
toward a house and save
a lot of anger, frustration and stress.

How's the job, new house, and Terri doing?  Have you been to many Bears 
games?  The Scarlet Knights
have been so inconsistent this year.  I think a lot is due to their youth.

Let's talk soon.

Kevin

If I understand you correctly, it may depend to an extent on season basis 
differentials as well.
Why don't you give me a call so I could better understand what you're trying

T.J.,

I need your LA address.  I'm sure I have it some place but I can't find it.
How's everything going?  How's Rena?  Are you heading home for the 
holidays or staying in LA?

Also,  if you have Lowery's address and phone # could you forward it.

Thanks,

Kevin

I'll tell you what.  You give us your "want"  list and we'll make sure you can do it all.
Of course, after you assemble the chair.

Stacy,

Kevin Ruscitti has requested a secondary firm ANR ML7 phy gas product for EOL.  I have located some language that you and Dale worked on back in May of 2000.  Please let me know if this language will be OK for our needs.  Also, will the current GTC for Phy gas need to be revised in any way?

Thanks,

CW

A US Gas Transaction with Enron North America Corp., under which Seller shall sell and Buyer shall purchase a quantity of natural gas equal to the Daily Contract Quantity at the Contract Price on a secondary firm basis. The Contract Price shall be as submitted by Counterparty via the Website.  The Period of Delivery shall be from the Effective Date through the Termination Date.
The term of the Transaction shall correspond to the date(s) set forth in the Product description on the Website.
The transaction is for delivery at the ANR Pipeline Company ML7 interconnect.  The volumes scheduled to be delivered are subject to reductions due to normal operational constraints on the ANR  Pipeline Company pipelines based upon historical operating conditions.  The reductions caused by these constraints are excused nonperformance and are not considered a failure to receive or deliver firm gas.  In the event that the volumes scheduled are reduced due to such normal operational constraints, Buyer may designate a secondary firm delivery location.
The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the Contractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be millions of British thermal units and the quantity shown shall be in millions of BTUs per day.

Subject:	Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

We'll just be doing some house shopping.  I think we're going to postpone the upgrade to
the existing house and look to buy a new house.  This would eliminate the need to move
out for 6 months.  I'm dying to live in a house that is complete.  Anyway, besides this we
don't seem to have much going on.  I'll just need to go into work for a few hours on Sunday.

Let me know what you want to do.

Of course your Dad would be invited to anything we do, but if you'd rather spend the
time alone with him that weekend we could always make it another weekend.  The only
problem with the 12th is that we'll be consumed with the move the entire weekend.  Let
me know what works for you.  We're flexible after the 12th.

You're correct, Enron doesn't get too involved in these conventions.  I don't know 
why.  It seems that some of the desks have some functions but mine never does.   My desk
seems to be pretty apathetic (probably not a good thing).  I think we've relied, more than
any of our other desks, on the financial and e-commerce sides of the business.  Probably
not a great thing.  Anyway, lets get together for a cocktail or dinner sometime within the 
next month.  Did you guys move to the Galleria location yet.  Let me know - we'll go get 
a big steak at Morton's or Ruths' Chris.  I assume a country boy like you is into some
good red meat.

Stamos, 

Glad everyone had a good time at Sweets'.  I hope he had a blast.

In terms of your email reply,
you can have Calpine.  How are they going to make money long term if price 
caps are instituted?  This obviously would be the stupidest policy.  In addition
their exposure to the CA crisis must be pretty significant - when and how are they
going to get paid?  I wouldn't want to bank on the energy market in the most 
regulated state in the country.  Plus, if the state backs energy purchases, it's 
going to get to the point where who wants to own CA credit??  PG&E and Edison
International are doomed, as they should be.  The state of CA is going to go
down the tubes unless they find some good leadership.  Unfortunately, noone
out there seems to have the least clue on how to solve the problem.  The politicians
are a complete joke.  It is incredibly disheartening to witness the absolute stupidity
of the CA politicians in addressing this issue.  They seem to be much more focused 
on finger pointing than coming up with a viable solution.  I honestly think they are incable
of solving the problem.

Stamos,

I don't think many buying opportunities out there.   The economy is going to get 
crushed this year.  There's only one place to put one's money now, and that is in cash.
The manufacturing sector is in dire straits and you will continue to see an increase in
plant shutdowns and company layoffs.  The Fed could continue to lower rates but there'll
be little capital investment if consumer spending dries up.  I feel we've just seen the beginning.  
I think the Dow will be trading under 8000 by the end of April.

Psychologically, the California crisis will add to consumer fear.  The crisis is not a short term
problem.  As a result, barring any Federal bailout, you could kiss that state's economy goodbye.
Let me ask you a question; if you were paying (1) the highest real estate prices in the country, and 
(2) the highest energy prices for the least reliable power, in (3) the midst of a hi-tech meltdown, what would
keep you or your company from closing shop and moving to a different state??  If you own any
CA real estate, sell.  The only way to solve the CA energy crisis is to reduce demand or increase supply.
Since CA doesn't want any power plants in its backyard, the supply issue likely won't be solved anytime
soon.  So, how do impact demand??  You have to price energy(power/gas) so high that
the discretionary user (household, manufacturer, commercial store) conserves by closing its plant, cutting
back on the thermastat or running the commercial operation during off-peak hours.  California will see
this reduction in demand over time.  If the blackouts subside it's because so many businesses have
closed their doors for good or moved to another state.  Without this, the blackouts will get much worse.
If the state tries to get into the business of buying and selling electricity and gas, I would bet it will go
bankrupt within 2-3 yrs.  Could you imagine the impact on the national economy from the bankruptcy 
of the U.S.'s most prosperous state.  Obviously this is only my opinion, but I would keep my eyes on
the energy markets - that's where the key to the turnaround lies.  Take Care and thanks for the email.


Kevin

That state will never be the same.  My prediction is that the state will be
bankrupt within the next 2 years unless the Federal Gov't bails it out.  I hope
Lowery has held off on buying his house.

Talk to you this weekend.  I blew off the Montana trip so I'll be home.

Great to hear from you.  Looking forward to meeting in Houston for a baseball game.
Conway will be in Corpis soon so we should be able to do a weekend.  We should start
construction on the house in May - what an incredibly long process it is.  I definitely would
not do it if I had to do it over again.  One redeeming factor is that we bought on a good 
block.  We definitely have the ugliest house on the block.  We should get a pop in real
estate also when all the California companies start migrating to Texas.  

Joking aside, unless you guys have incredibly mild weather this summer combined with
a lot of rainfall, you're summer will suck.  There is no doubt that the CA economy is going
to suffer a great recession.  You have a shortage of supply so the only way to ease the
problem is to reduce demand.  This usually occurs when prices reach levels where the price
sensitive buyers cut back.  However, with your boy Grey Davis pushing for  price caps, this won't
happen.   The next way for demand to be trimmed is for companies to leave, so this will probably
need to happen to an extent for the problem to ease.  The other factor, of course, is that you
could have an increase in supply - new power plants.  But being that the amt. of time it takes to 
develop and build a power plant in CA is about 3 times as long as in most other states combined
with the fact that CA hasn't had a new power plant in the last 10 years, an increase in supply
doesn't seem likely in the short term.  Again, this is only my opinion, so you could take it with
a grain of salt.  

Talk to you soon.

Kevin

BL,

Have you experienced any blackouts yet?  I think you'll see a lot this summer.
What does everyone think about the situation?  Do they think it's a threat or not?  I think
the state is in for a horrific summer - I hope it doesn't turn out that way, but it'll be incredibly
difficult to avoid.

Hope everything's going well with work and with the family.  When's the next time you'll
be in Dallas?  Let me know.

Per our conversation this morning, the attached spreadsheet should give you an idea how we are managing NGPL NSS storage.  The spreadsheet breaks out the current inventory level and the daily rights associated with the storage.

*** Springsteen visits Jersey Shore club

ASBURY PARK, N.J. (AP) - A legendary Jersey Shore rock club had a
special guest at its birthday party over the weekend: Bruce
Springsteen. The Boss made a surprise appearance Sunday night before
about 2,500 fans at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park. The show, which
marked the one-year anniversary of the club's reopening, featured
another shore favorite, Southside Johnny and Asbury Jukes, and
rocker Graham Parker. Springsteen showed up on stage at about 8:40
p.m. and performed with the band and Parker for about an hour. The
set featured several Springsteen songs and some Southside staples,
along with a cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Born on the
Bayou."

I saw that, unbelievable huh?  The sad thing is that the folks I work with never heard of Jack Kerouac nor "On the Road".  
Probably not surprising considering most are from Texas.  How's everything going?  Did you get an opportunity to call
Kampy.  How's the job search progressing?

Before I forget, was there a guy in our MBA class named Chris Sevrson or something like that?  An email was forwarded
to me and that name was on the forward list and it sounded familiar.  

Any big plans for the weekend?  We're just hanging around Houston.  It seems every weekend for the past year+ we've
been doing some type of house work.  Hopefully one day it will slow.  Talk to you soon.

Lowery is doing some more training in San Marco, about 45 minutes north of San Antonio.  I imagine he was staying on the River Walk so he had something to do with Kim.  If he had any balls at all he'd stick around for the weekend.

The reason I asked about Chris Sevrens is that he was on the list (you'll see) of this email.  I don't know if you heard about it but
the author of the email got fired shortly after it circulated through Wall St.  Anyway, thought you might find it amusing.  Start from
the bottom of this email and work your way up.  It's interesting to see the path it took to so many people.  You'll see Sevrens name
near the bottom.

I think Enron is going to $10.  I've been quite concerned for
the last month+.  It looks like a number of the senior execs have
done some questionable acts.  It's been quite the moral buster.  They
need to clean shop and get rid of the CEO and entire board for
letting these types of actions occur.  We will never regain investor
confidence until this occurs.  

The problem with ENE is that we make an incredible amt of money on 
the wholesale side of the energy business (natural gas and power) but
we have thrown money at a myriad of bad businesses that lost lots of
money (Azurix water co., broadband, residential marketing.  They need
to get someone in here that will eliminate these losers and focus on
the core businesses.  In my opinion, some of these execs, former and current,
should go to jail.  It's amazing how a group of guys could ruin a great 
company.  I'm sure there will be a grad school case study and a book
written about this.  I'm sure it will be a best seller.

Anyway, let me get off my soapbox.  I'm glad to hear you got a new job.
That would be great if Chris gets the package and looks for something
more enjoyable.  Congrats to you brother and make sure you tell your
folks I was asking about them. 

Lisa and I haven't finalized any plans to NJ in Jan but I'll let you
know as soon as we do.  We're both looking forward to hooking up
with you guys.

Conway won't have to go overseas.  He said he's the last one they'll
activate.  His cell phone # is 240-298-7007.  I have to look for his 
email but i'll let you know when I find it.  

Take care and good to hear from you.

Kevin

Dude,
Good thing I took some of my Pru 401K $$ and bought Enron in February, when
I opened my roll-over IRA.

Besides the job how's everything else going with you and the lovely Lisa?

Things could not be more hectic over here. I'm switching jobs next month.
Gave the dot.com world a shot and timed it wrong. When the company you are
working for is borrowing $$ from the VC to meet payroll and has not locked
in the final round of funding, you know it is time to move along. Will be
joining a NY Real Estate Brokerage House, where I'm friend with the guys.
Will be helping them run their Corporate Service Group.

Lets see what else is going on.

Chrissy is trying to decide if she is going to volunteer for the Merrill
Lynch layoff package that is being offered. I want her to, because her boss
is making her life miserable.

My father had triple by-pass surgery last month. He is doing fine now and it
is probably for the better in the long run that he had the procedure done.

And on good note- My brother got engaged.

I lost Mr. Conway's tele # and email address, can you shoot it over to me.
Would like to drop him a message. Is he still State side? hopefully.

Remember to drop me a note when you finalize your visit back to NJ in
January, so we can hook up.

Tell Lisa and the family that we send our regards,

I'm not going to be able to make it.  I talked to Lisa and we're heading
back to NJ for her friends wedding.  I'm hoping to make a trip to CA
sometime next year.  I hope you have a great time and tell Lulenski I
said hi.

Do you know if you're coming out yet? Got e-mails from
Lulenski (he's coming) and Sarhatt (he's not). I'm
planning to go to the beer bust and picnic for sure
and probably the Saturday night event if enough of you
guys are interested. Let me know.

Steve,

Not a lot.  Just working and watching my company's stock get the
shit kicked out of it.  

I did get married last year, but everything else has been pretty quiet.
How 'bout yourself.  What have you been up to?  Who have you kept in

Subject: Anderson '96 Reunion - 4 weeks away!


Dear Class of 1996,

**Note:  Response to this email requested, thanks!

Well, our much anticipated 5-year Reunion is less than a month away!
The
planning committe is working hard on the events, and we are trying to
firm
up the list of attendees.  We got a GREAT response to the last email,
thanks
for taking the time to let us know your status.  If you haven't
responded
yet, please do so just so we can adequately reserve space.

Just to remind some of you, the event will take place on: *** November
2-4th
*** in Los Angeles, CA!   The rough schedule of events is shown below.
In a
subsequent email today or tomorrow we will provide some details about
hotel
accommodations.  You will also be receiving an information packet from
the
Alumni Office in a mailing that should be out next week.

If you are planning to fly I've heard there are some great deals on
Southwest and United among others (<$100 from SF).  Anderson Alums also
get
a 10% on Southwest (see below)

If you would like to respond to this email regarding your status, please
use
this form:

1) Status of your email account
	A)  Got this info - email address is correct
	B)  Got this info - but would prefer to use another address next
time
	C)  I did not get this info (not sure how you would answer this,
but...)

Note:  You may have received this note twice - it was sent to all
members of
the Class of 1996 currently registered in the Alumni Database, as well
as to
the Class of 1996 Email List (which is opt-in).

2) Plans for attending the Reunion Weekend
	A)  Will definitely be Attending
	B)  Will make a brief appearance (1 or 2 events)
	C)  Still Deciding
	D)  Will not be Attending (but wish I could)

3) Comments/Suggestions - Any thoughts on how to make this a GREAT
reunion?

As mentioned previously, its been a rough year for many of us and it
would
be great to end the year with some fun and good times!  I can tell you
from
what we've been hearing, and from the number of responses received, that
we
are going to have an awesome turnout for the events, so you don't want
to
miss out!!!   So get your tickets, review your facebook (so who was that
Doug Dahl character anyways), dust off the old Anderson attire and let's
party!!

Sincerely,
Steve Smith

Great to hear from you.  Glad to know everyone's doing well.
Did you know Moller was going to be on TV or were you just channel
surfing?  How did he do?

Work's going OK.  ENE stock has been getting destroyed.  A lot
of negative press abt management.  I would sell your shares if
you still have them.  It's $30 right know but I have a feeling 
it's going lower.  Tell Dave also if you talk to him.  News has

Anyway, Lisa's job is going great - she's really happy.  We haven't
been up to a lot lately - just hanging around the neighborhood.

The anthrax scares and the terrorist stories are really scary.  What
a bunch of nuts we have living in this world.  I have a feeling it
could get worse before it gets better.  Don't open any letters from
unknown companies or counterparties.  Take care of yourself and Gloria

Gentlemen - I hope you all are doing well.  I wanted to follow up with guys
on supper club.  I believe it's our turn in the "rotation".  ML and I
thought it might be fun to change it up a bit and go some place like the
Mucky Duck where we could eat and watch a band or go somewhere like the
Laugh Stop for dinner and a comedy hour.  We will treat on the dinner and
first round of drinks.  I would say on all drinks but given Kevin's past
rampages with the bottles of wine I better not guarantee full payment of
that at a restaurant.  If that's a problem, I can always bring Kevin a small
flask and straw that he can have during the night. 

ML talked to Lisa and I talked to Dax and it sounds like Sunday, November
11th will be the only date that might work.  Follow back up with me and let
me know if that will work.  Take care and talk to you soon.

C'mon you can play 18 then do housework all afternoon.  If you're just starting you don't get many invitations!  Truthfully, I'm usually napping after golf, you're always surprised how tired you get after 18 holes!

I've gotten some interest from various groups within EES, EGM and hopefully Industrial Markets, but it's tough.  Everybody is cautious, nobody's going gangbusters.  I've been pounding the pavement almost full time for 2 weeks.  Need to close something before heading back to Seoul.  I brought my family back to Houston and they're staying, but I'll head back to Seoul in a week or 2.

I think the only difference btw the 330Ci and the 330i is that the Ci
is a 2 door.  

Had a choice btw Wed and Thur game - chose Wed.  Not that disappointed
though as the Astros proved to be the biggest bunch of pussies in the
ML.  They were more concerned with not giving up a homer to Bonds than
with winning the game.  Now they stand a chance of not making the playoffs
at all.  If you ask me they don't deserve it and the mgr should be fired.

It was great to hear the fans booing the home team every other inning.  I'm
sure they lost a lot of fans over those 2 games.

Anyway, what's up on your front.  Are you still going out to Cali to visit
Hop and Denise?  How's flying?

I think the 330 is the better call.  You really don't want a BMW as a family
car anyway until the kids are much older.  I don't know what the prices are
but the 330ic is pretty sweet.

I heard it's pretty sweet.  I have a feeling we're going to lean toward
the 330i just b/c everything I've read rates it the best in its class.
I feel like the 5 series will be too big for us right now (w/o kids) but
we should get a better feel this weekend.  I'll keep you informed.

Subject: RE: 


Drive 'em both, but at least for the older one's the 8 cyl was MUCH
smoother.  It really comes down to what you want.   Unless you're really
pushing it you won't notice much of a difference.  However, what you
will
notice is that the 6cyl will be working a lot harder (i.e. louder).
Once
you jump into the 5 you're in the luxury market and you probably want a
smoother car with plenty of torque (8 cyl).  Especially the way you
drive
(not winding the engine out in every gear) you'll feel more low end
power in
the 540.  Again, it comes down to the pax.  If you're hauling 2 most of
the
time, the 530 is probably fine;. hauling 4 it will be sucking wind a
bit.
Remember when you're on a test drive the car isn't configured the way it
will be in real life.  The tires will be under inflated, the gas tank
(large
in that car, like 14 gal ~90 pounds) and no passengers so your
performance
will seem better.  My best advice when looking at cars in that price
range
is to insist on an extended (overnight or over a weekend) test drive of
both.  You don't want to buy and wish you had bought the other a couple
of
weeks later.  Finally, think about long term (kids, etc) if you plan on
hanging onto it as long as the Miata.  It's not uncommon for a bimmer to
go
2-300,000 miles without engine work so you can hang onto them for quite
a
while if you stay up on the maintenance.  Give me a buzz at home
(301.737.5366) tonight if you want to yap about it.

about how often you might be hauling 3-4 people.  If you think it's a
factor, spend some time on an extended test drive sitting in the back.
I'd
still look at the Vovlvo S-60 twin turbo, it might surprise you.

I was at the game last night sitting in home run territory - section

It was one of the most disappointing games i've ever attended.  the
astros
don't even deserve to make the playoffs after their cowardly play.  the 
manager's an idiot - intentionally walking Bonds with guys on 1st and
2nd
with 2 outs.

Anyway, in terms of the Miata, the dealer recommended abt $1300 worth of
work.
Of course i told him to just get the thing running ($450).  The problem
is
the blue book value is only $2500 so i can't see putting another grand
into it.
I'll probably just sell it to someone who races miata's (which is really
big
in Texas) or donate it to charity and take the tax write off.

We haven't test driven anything yet but it looks like we're leaning
toward the
BMW 330i.  It seems to get great reviews, the main downside is that it's
a little
small - but still sporty.  We'll go for test drives this weekend and
should buy
or lease (still undecided) something in the next couple weeks.

How's everything on your front.  Less classroom time and more flying
time???

That faggot Lowery was in Austin this past weekend.  I don't expect him
to call
of course but it shows how easily he could've gotten to Houston while he
was 
working for 8 mos. in Dallas.

My miata broke down this past weekend.  I didn't think it would be

looking forward to the process although the internet should make
it less painful than it was 9.5 years ago.  Wow, I can't believe

I'm going to see Bonds play on Wednesday night.  Hoping he'll be
going for the record that night (either a tie or to break it).  I
scored tix in section 154 - prime bonds territory.  Check out the

Thanks for the advice.  Much appreciated.  We plan on test driving
this weekend.  The BMW has a racing track in the back of the dealership -
I heard it's pretty sweet.  I have a feeling we're going to lean toward
the 330i just b/c everything I've read rates it the best in its class.
I feel like the 5 series will be too big for us right now (w/o kids) but
we should get a better feel this weekend.  I'll keep you informed.

Thanks again.

Subject: RE: 


Drive 'em both, but at least for the older one's the 8 cyl was MUCH
smoother.  It really comes down to what you want.   Unless you're really
pushing it you won't notice much of a difference.  However, what you will
notice is that the 6cyl will be working a lot harder (i.e. louder).  Once
you jump into the 5 you're in the luxury market and you probably want a
smoother car with plenty of torque (8 cyl).  Especially the way you drive
(not winding the engine out in every gear) you'll feel more low end power in
the 540.  Again, it comes down to the pax.  If you're hauling 2 most of the
time, the 530 is probably fine;. hauling 4 it will be sucking wind a bit.
Remember when you're on a test drive the car isn't configured the way it
will be in real life.  The tires will be under inflated, the gas tank (large
in that car, like 14 gal ~90 pounds) and no passengers so your performance
will seem better.  My best advice when looking at cars in that price range
is to insist on an extended (overnight or over a weekend) test drive of
both.  You don't want to buy and wish you had bought the other a couple of
weeks later.  Finally, think about long term (kids, etc) if you plan on
hanging onto it as long as the Miata.  It's not uncommon for a bimmer to go
2-300,000 miles without engine work so you can hang onto them for quite a
while if you stay up on the maintenance.  Give me a buzz at home
(301.737.5366) tonight if you want to yap about it.

Kamp,

Did you watch the Astros / Giants game last night.  It was embarrassing.  I've never
seen such a cowardly performance by a baseball team (of course I'm talking abt the
Astros).  When do you ever walk a guy with runners on 1st and 2nd, your team is 
down by 1 run and there is 2 outs?  Answer:  NEVER.  According to Dierker,
"... the critical walk was the one with runners on first and second," Dierker said. "We did that because Jeff Kent was 3-for-17 against Williams and had struck out the last five at-bats (against him), so he showed some dominance against him. Obviously, you don't want to put another runner on base and move the runners another base in scoring position unless you have a very compelling reason, and we did.

How's long's this clown been managing.  I guess he hasn't followed Kent the last few years.  It wasn't like he was walking Bonds to get to 
Ivan DeJesus.  He doesn't even have the sack to admit he fucked up.  I've never seen fans boo their home team so much since the days of Michael Jack.

Have you and Patty been getting any sleep? How's Jack?

I was at the game last night sitting in home run territory - section 154.
It was one of the most disappointing games i've ever attended.  the astros
don't even deserve to make the playoffs after their cowardly play.  the 
manager's an idiot - intentionally walking Bonds with guys on 1st and 2nd
with 2 outs.

Anyway, in terms of the Miata, the dealer recommended abt $1300 worth of work.
Of course i told him to just get the thing running ($450).  The problem is
the blue book value is only $2500 so i can't see putting another grand into it.
I'll probably just sell it to someone who races miata's (which is really big
in Texas) or donate it to charity and take the tax write off.

We haven't test driven anything yet but it looks like we're leaning toward the
BMW 330i.  It seems to get great reviews, the main downside is that it's a little
small - but still sporty.  We'll go for test drives this weekend and should buy
or lease (still undecided) something in the next couple weeks.

How's everything on your front.  Less classroom time and more flying time???

That faggot Lowery was in Austin this past weekend.  I don't expect him to call
of course but it shows how easily he could've gotten to Houston while he was 
working for 8 mos. in Dallas.

Later,

kevin

Sorry to hear about the turbo Miata.  What happened to it?  Can't it be
fixed or are you just abandoning it?  Where are you leaning in terms of a
new car?  On my end, the classic motorcycle is buzzing like  a champ and a
complete blast to drive.

What's with the faggot Astro's walking your boy?  At least he pocketed one
record.

I don't have TJ's email w/ me, but I'm sure he never expected you to

My miata broke down this past weekend.  I didn't think it would be
that soon.  It looks like I'm forced to buy a new car.  I'm not 
looking forward to the process although the internet should make
it less painful than it was 9.5 years ago.  Wow, I can't believe
I've owned the Miata for over 9 yrs.  

I'm going to see Bonds play on Wednesday night.  Hoping he'll be
going for the record that night (either a tie or to break it).  I
scored tix in section 154 - prime bonds territory.  Check out the
section on the Houston Astros website.

Talk to you soon.

How's everything going -I assume great?  How's the baby and Patty
doing?

How 'bout that Barry Bonds?  You must be in heaven - (1) baby boy,
(2) Yanks win the division, (3) Bonds goes for record.

I think Bonds is going to break the record Wednesday night in Houston.
Guess who'll be sitting in section 154 (check it out on the Astros
website) waiting for # 71.  Look for me on TV.

No,

There's been a lot of shit happening with my company and frankely,
I don't know what's going to happen over the next few months.  As a 
result, we decided to wait at least a few months until our financial
situation is better known.  

Glad to hear everything's going well.  Did you go out to California?
What are your plans over Thanksgiving?

Chump,

I've been super busy the last two weeks.  The pace seems to be cyclical and
we are definitely in high gear right now.  I don't expect it to slack off
until the Thanksgiving break with another push coming just before Xmas.  The
good news is, I am a third of the way through.

Did you ever get a car?

Frank

PS  Did you see WVU put up 80 on RU?  They suck!

AP Camden,NJ: A terrorist cell has been broken up in Camden just east of
Philadelphia. Four of the members have been apprehended by the Camden
Police, with the fifth still at large. Arrested in the Camden sweep were
Bin Eatin, Bin Smokin, Bin Sleepin and Bin Drinkin. All are being held on
illegal immigration
charges. Police stated that they can find no one fitting the description of
the fifth cell member, Bin Workin, in the area. But Camden Police are
confident that anyone who resembles Bin Workin would be easy to spot in
Camden.

Robin,

How's everything in NY?  The flow of info around here has been horrible.  I
have no idea on what's happening - a bad situation to be in obviously.  We're
just reading all the news on the wires.

Just starting to look at some options in case the trading desk vanishes.  Do
you know if Sempra in CT is still looking for people.  I figure it's time to see
what else may be out there.

I'm sure we'll talk a little later.

Let me tell you who won't win - RU.  They are arguably the worst
division 1 football team I've ever seen.  I saw them for the 1st time
this weekend on TV.  They are horrible.  Hope everything's going well.
Life at Enron sucks.  I'm sure you've been following the situation.
I'm sure there'll be a #1 bestseller written about this circus.  Talk

Kevin,

This has to be one of the *ugly* games of the year.  The only saving
grace (and it isn't much of one either) is that the winner gets to say
they won their last game.  For Cal, that would be their only win.  I'm
going to be in OC at my in-laws, and I'm going to try to get an Internet
broadcast.

If Rutgers wins, I'll buy you a drink the next time I see you (actually
I'll buy you a drink regardless).  

Hi to Lisa - hope you guys have a Happy Thanksgiving.
